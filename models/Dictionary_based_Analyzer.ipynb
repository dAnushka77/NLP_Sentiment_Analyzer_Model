       "      <td>Dropship: United Peace Force is a fantastic flight combat game that you should try and pick up cheap because it has been out for awhile now. The whole game is fast, competitive, has a steep learning curve with realistic battle sequences, amazing replay functions (cinematic), huge explosions, 20 tough missions, several Vertical Take-Off &amp; Landing (VTL) vehicles, 10 ground assault vehicles (you also play on the ground sometimes driving tanks and other army vehicles), helicopters, 4 different country landscapes (5 missions per level), a coherent plot, futuristic weapons, sky combat, sea combat, land combat and a solid flight interface.\\nThe essence of the game is to drop tanks and vehicles at designated waypoints and then fly around the place targeting the enemy and dog fighting in the sky. Your VTLs range anywhere from full size bombers to light fighter jets for scramble defense.

       "      <td>This game has a lot of problems. For one, it's a documentary pretending to be a video game, leaving most of the game aspects subpar at best. Controls are sluggish and glitchy, often resulting in the main character getting stuck midair or falling to her death after sliding off of a cliff due to the delay between commanding her to jump and her actually jumping. Other issues include poor camera management that occasionally leaves one character off screen and inconsistent mechanics such as allowing water to kill you in most levels except one. Lastly, controlling the Bola is a huge pain and pretty much impossible to use with any real accuracy.\\n\\nMost of the puzzles consist merely of jumping from one ledge to another. I'd say there are less than 5 actual puzzles (i.e. consisting of more than just platforming) in the entire game, summing to less than 20 minutes of play time. These puzzles were enjoyable, but you do spend an awful lot of time simply walking and jumping from left to right.\\n\\nThe cultural insights to the Alaskan natives are very well presented and you're pretty much guaranteed to unlock all 24 of them as you play through the game. I think only 2 of them are missable. Watching these videos as they unlock is necessary in order to understand the content of each level (such as why the northern lights want to hug you to death or why midget natives live underground), yet some of the videos also spoil upcoming game content in the levels. So you lose out on the gaming aspects if you watch the videos but you lose out on understanding the setting if you don't. This makes for a lose-lose situation either way.\\n\\nThe game itself directly follows a story told by the Alaskan natives, and I'd say each level fits very well with the narration. The story isn't spectacular, but at least it adds some meaning to your otherwise suicidal wandering through the blizzard. There's only one thing about the story I didn't understand: how does chipping an axe have anything to do with caribou feet? This is a rather strange ending to an otherwise interesting fable about the cause of a blizzard.\\n\\nIf you choose to purchase Never Alone: Foxtales, you will have the opportunity to play through another story told by the Alaskan natives.  As with the main game, this is another (albeit shorter) documentary disguised as a video game.  Unfortunately, this DLC features even worse controls and even worse mechanic inconsistencies than the main game.  Controls maintain their sluggish feeling present in Never Alone and now add control for paddling a boat that couldn't possibly be any worse.  Thrown rocks break when they hit the ground unless the puzzle specifically requires them to hit the ground.  Water now doesn't seem to kill you except for in two or three sections which doesn't seem to make any sense.\\n\\nThe puzzles are far better in Foxtales than in Never Alone, showing off some actual creativity in design and making for a game that is not comprised solely of jumping left to right on moving platforms; however, the puzzles only feature two mechanics in the entire game--fox moves the water currents and Nuna throws rocks--so plan on repeating that a lot.  The final puzzle requires precision and timing, which is quite miserable given the control issues.  About 75% of this game does leave you doing nothing more than paddling a boat, so as with Never Alone you're still basically just moving left to right but now you have the occasional interruption of a puzzle.\\n\\nThe five Insight videos in Foxtales are much less insightful and interesting than in Never Alone.  As indicated by the first Insight video, the game developers thought this story about a giant mouse and respect for animals would make a good game expansion, so they threw a game together without really thinking about the Insight videos that should accompany the game.\\n\\nI can't help but to conclude the same thing for both Never Alone and Foxtales: these are absolutely gorgeous games featuring a well-produced documentary wrapped up inside a boring and inconsistent platformer.  Foxtales has better puzzles than Never Alone, but they're accompanied by worse videos.  In either case, unlocking the documentary will require playing through a game that fails to offer any real enjoyment or creativity in level design.</td>\n",

The whole game is fast, competitive, has a steep learning curve with realistic battle sequences, amazing replay functions (cinematic), huge explosions, 20 tough missions, several Vertical Take-Off & Landing (VTL) vehicles, 10 ground assault vehicles (you also play on the ground sometimes driving tanks and other army vehicles), helicopters, 4 different country landscapes (5 missions per level), a coherent plot, futuristic weapons, sky combat, sea combat, land combat and a solid flight interface.\\nThe essence of the game is to drop tanks and vehicles at designated waypoints and then fly around the place targeting the enemy and dog fighting in the sky. Your VTLs range anywhere from full size bombers to light fighter jets for scramble defense. The whole game is set slightly in the future so all the gadgets and planes look really stealthy and sleek.\\nThe actual game play itself is amazing with hyper-realistic controls and a very well done environment. Graphics have got better since this was released on the PS2 but still the game is one of the most enjoyable flight combat games out there and is worth every single penny except for one dismal feature!......\\nTHE IS NO FREE FLIGHT OR MULTIPLAYER MODE!\\nThis brings the game down a star. It would have been simple to do a free flight frag em up or at least a multiplayer dog fight or co-op mode, but no they simply did not give us any at all which is a big shame since the game play was awesome.\\n4 BIG STARS minus 1 for missing the basics of what a packaged game like this needs. The 20 missions however have a lot of replay value.\\nBring on Dropship 2 please soon!   \n",
       "1612  This game has a lot of problems. For one, it's a documentary pretending to be a video game, leaving most of the game aspects subpar at best. Controls are sluggish and glitchy, often resulting in the main character getting stuck midair or falling to her death after sliding off of a cliff due to the delay between commanding her to jump and her actually jumping. Other issues include poor camera management that occasionally leaves one character off screen and inconsistent mechanics such as allowing water to kill you in most levels except one. Lastly, controlling the Bola is a huge pain and pretty much impossible to use with any real accuracy.\\n\\nMost of the puzzles consist merely of jumping from one ledge to another. I'd say there are less than 5 actual puzzles (i.e. consisting of more than just platforming) in the entire game, summing to less than 20 minutes of play time. These puzzles were enjoyable, but you do spend an awful lot of time simply walking and jumping from left to right.\\n\\nThe cultural insights to the Alaskan natives are very well presented and you're pretty much guaranteed to unlock all 24 of them as you play through the game. I think only 2 of them are missable. Watching these videos as they unlock is necessary in order to understand the content of each level (such as why the northern lights want to hug you to death or why midget natives live underground), yet some of the videos also spoil upcoming game content in the levels. So you lose out on the gaming aspects if you watch the videos but you lose out on understanding the setting if you don't. This makes for a lose-lose situation either way.\\n\\nThe game itself directly follows a story told by the Alaskan natives, and I'd say each level fits very well with the narration. The story isn't spectacular, but at least it adds some meaning to your otherwise suicidal wandering through the blizzard. There's only one thing about the story I didn't understand: how does chipping an axe have anything to do with caribou feet? This is a rather strange ending to an otherwise interesting fable about the cause of a blizzard.\\n\\nIf you choose to purchase Never Alone: Foxtales, you will have the opportunity to play through another story told by the Alaskan natives.  As with the main game, this is another (albeit shorter) documentary disguised as a video game.  Unfortunately, this DLC features even worse controls and even worse mechanic inconsistencies than the main game.  Controls maintain their sluggish feeling present in Never Alone and now add control for paddling a boat that couldn't possibly be any worse.  Thrown rocks break when they hit the ground unless the puzzle specifically requires them to hit the ground.  Water now doesn't seem to kill you except for in two or three sections which doesn't seem to make any sense.\\n\\nThe puzzles are far better in Foxtales than in Never Alone, showing off some actual creativity in design and making for a game that is not comprised solely of jumping left to right on moving platforms; however, the puzzles only feature two mechanics in the entire game--fox moves the water currents and Nuna throws rocks--so plan on repeating that a lot.  The final puzzle requires precision and timing, which is quite miserable given the control issues.  About 75% of this game does leave you doing nothing more than paddling a boat, so as with Never Alone you're still basically just moving left to right but now you have the occasional interruption of a puzzle.\\n\\nThe five Insight videos in Foxtales are much less insightful and interesting than in Never Alone.  As indicated by the first Insight video, the game developers thought this story about a giant mouse and respect for animals would make a good game expansion, so they threw a game together without really thinking about the Insight videos that should accompany the game.\\n\\nI can't help but to conclude the same thing for both Never Alone and Foxtales: these are absolutely gorgeous games featuring a well-produced documentary wrapped up inside a boring and inconsistent platformer.  Foxtales has better puzzles than Never Alone, but they're accompanied by worse videos.  In either case, unlocking the documentary will require playing through a game that fails to offer any real enjoyment or creativity in level design.   \n",

Second one purchased. Now purchasing three of the original WII remotes. These do not stand up to the boy play of my sons. Took over a month to arrive.

       "1612  this game has a lot of problems for one its a documentary pretending to be a video game leaving most of the game aspects subpar at best controls are sluggish and glitchy often resulting in the main character getting stuck midair or falling to her death after sliding off of a cliff due to the delay between commanding her to jump and her actually jumping other issues include poor camera management that occasionally leaves one character off screen and inconsistent mechanics such as allowing water to kill you in most levels except one lastly controlling the bola is a huge pain and pretty much impossible to use with any real accuracy\\n\\nmost of the puzzles consist merely of jumping from one ledge to another id say there are less than 5 actual puzzles ie consisting of more than just platforming in the entire game summing to less than 20 minutes of play time these puzzles were enjoyable but you do spend an awful lot of time simply walking and jumping from left to right\\n\\nthe cultural insights to the alaskan natives are very well presented and youre pretty much guaranteed to unlock all 24 of them as you play through the game i think only 2 of them are missable watching these videos as they unlock is necessary in order to understand the content of each level such as why the northern lights want to hug you to death or why midget natives live underground yet some of the videos also spoil upcoming game content in the levels so you lose out on the gaming aspects if you watch the videos but you lose out on understanding the setting if you dont this makes for a loselose situation either way\\n\\nthe game itself directly follows a story told by the alaskan natives and id say each level fits very well with the narration the story isnt spectacular but at least it adds some meaning to your otherwise suicidal wandering through the blizzard theres only one thing about the story i didnt understand how does chipping an axe have anything to do with caribou feet this is a rather strange ending to an otherwise interesting fable about the cause of a blizzard\\n\\nif you choose to purchase never alone foxtales you will have the opportunity to play through another story told by the alaskan natives  as with the main game this is another albeit shorter documentary disguised as a video game  unfortunately this dlc features even worse controls and even worse mechanic inconsistencies than the main game  controls maintain their sluggish feeling present in never alone and now add control for paddling a boat that couldnt possibly be any worse  thrown rocks break when they hit the ground unless the puzzle specifically requires them to hit the ground  water now doesnt seem to kill you except for in two or three sections which doesnt seem to make any sense\\n\\nthe puzzles are far better in foxtales than in never alone showing off some actual creativity in design and making for a game that is not comprised solely of jumping left to right on moving platforms however the puzzles only feature two mechanics in the entire gamefox moves the water currents and nuna throws rocksso plan on repeating that a lot  the final puzzle requires precision and timing which is quite miserable given the control issues  about 75 of this game does leave you doing nothing more than paddling a boat so as with never alone youre still basically just moving left to right but now you have the occasional interruption of a puzzle\\n\\nthe five insight videos in foxtales are much less insightful and interesting than in never alone  as indicated by the first insight video the game developers thought this story about a giant mouse and respect for animals would make a good game expansion so they threw a game together without really thinking about the insight videos that should accompany the game\\n\\ni cant help but to conclude the same thing for both never alone and foxtales these are absolutely gorgeous games featuring a wellproduced documentary wrapped up inside a boring and inconsistent platformer  foxtales has better puzzles than never alone but theyre accompanied by worse videos  in either case unlocking the documentary will require playing through a game that fails to offer any real enjoyment or creativity in level design   \n",

       "      <td>Im in total despair.  Why?  I cant believe I missed this awesome game for so long!  I recently just got my very own PS Vita and was looking for new games to buy.  And I kept bypassing this game because of the title and the cover.  I assume it was a rhythm game and I definitely was wrong.\\n\\nDanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a mystery visual novel, where each chapter ends with a trial.  Think of Ace Attorney meets Hunger Games.  The plot is awesome and I just couldn't put the Vita down.  It was always one more minute.  The game takes place in a dystopian world, where The Tragedy destroy society as we know it.  Where rioting and despair rules.  But there is one place in the world that houses Hope for the future  Hope Peaks Academy.  However, what the school didn't realize that the enemy was already inside, turning their shelter into a killing game.  Now, you and 14 other students must survive the game.  The plot is slowly revealed between 6 chapters.  Each chapter lasts about 5-6 hours.  Each chapter revolves around 1 case.  The main plot is not revealed until the very end, so you don't really know the whole truth throughout the game.  So, the game keeps you interested because you become so invested in the characters well-being and figuring out their stories.\\n\\nNow come to the puzzle and fun part.  The trials are the real time stealers here.  I have not officially checked the time since I get too engrossed to notice, but the trial themselves takes about 2-3 hours to complete.  I like to note I played the game in Kind mode.  So, it was not as harsh as mean mode.  I found that the trial was not as difficult to figure out as long as you pay attention to the details and figure out the contradiction in the other students argument.  For me, I found Ace Attorney trials to be a little bit harder than this game.  In regards to the logic, I mean.  Its a little more obvious in DanganRonpa.  So, I didn't have too much difficulty getting through the trials.  I messed up a few times but that was due to the rhythm portion.  In any case, if you make a mistake, you can always redo it.  The only thing it affects is your final grade, but its not a huge deal.  The arguments are timed so you cant spend time thinking it over.  Luckily, you can pretty much save at any time except during the prologue.\\n\\nThe graphics are gorgeous and fit the visual novel idea perfectly.  Just imagine flat 2D story book characters against a 3D background.  Like a pop-up book.  I know Im explaining it badly but the visuals are awesome.  As an artist, I love the unique design for each character and it matches their personalities.  The backgrounds are clear and detailed.\\n\\nFor the technical, here is a quick summary.  There is no lag.  Transition from room to room is pretty seamless.  Navigation was easy to use.  I only used the English dialogue, so I cant comment on the Japanese.  But I usually find the Japanese voice acting to be awesome in any game.  Anyway, the English voice acting was good and definitely matches well with each character.  There is English subtitles.  It's not fully voiced throughout.  The trial and cut scenes are completely voiced.  At other times, it will be a quick comment from whoever is speaking.  I cant comment on translation from the Japanese either.  Sorry.  There are some extras at the end, but I haven't a chance to explore it yet.\\n\\nGET THIS GAME!  If you like visual novels with puzzle elements, this is for you.  And if you are an Ace Attorney fan, get it.  However, if you are not reader, then pass this one by.  I will like to note there are gruesome murder scenes and foul language for those buying for the children.  I have no regrets with this purchase.  I have already started DangaRonpa 2 and I will eventually go back to get all the bonuses for this game later.  But right now, I got my entertainment worth.  This is an awesome game.</td>\n",

       "3130  Im in total despair.  Why?  I cant believe I missed this awesome game for so long!  I recently just got my very own PS Vita and was looking for new games to buy.  And I kept bypassing this game because of the title and the cover.  I assume it was a rhythm game and I definitely was wrong.\\n\\nDanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a mystery visual novel, where each chapter ends with a trial.  Think of Ace Attorney meets Hunger Games.  The plot is awesome and I just couldn't put the Vita down.  It was always one more minute.  The game takes place in a dystopian world, where The Tragedy destroy society as we know it.  Where rioting and despair rules.  But there is one place in the world that houses Hope for the future  Hope Peaks Academy.  However, what the school didn't realize that the enemy was already inside, turning their shelter into a killing game.  Now, you and 14 other students must survive the game.  The plot is slowly revealed between 6 chapters.  Each chapter lasts about 5-6 hours.  Each chapter revolves around 1 case.  The main plot is not revealed until the very end, so you don't really know the whole truth throughout the game.  So, the game keeps you interested because you become so invested in the characters well-being and figuring out their stories.\\n\\nNow come to the puzzle and fun part.  The trials are the real time stealers here.  I have not officially checked the time since I get too engrossed to notice, but the trial themselves takes about 2-3 hours to complete.  I like to note I played the game in Kind mode.  So, it was not as harsh as mean mode.  I found that the trial was not as difficult to figure out as long as you pay attention to the details and figure out the contradiction in the other students argument.  For me, I found Ace Attorney trials to be a little bit harder than this game.  In regards to the logic, I mean.  Its a little more obvious in DanganRonpa.  So, I didn't have too much difficulty getting through the trials.  I messed up a few times but that was due to the rhythm portion.  In any case, if you make a mistake, you can always redo it.  The only thing it affects is your final grade, but its not a huge deal.  The arguments are timed so you cant spend time thinking it over.  Luckily, you can pretty much save at any time except during the prologue.\\n\\nThe graphics are gorgeous and fit the visual novel idea perfectly.  Just imagine flat 2D story book characters against a 3D background.  Like a pop-up book.  I know Im explaining it badly but the visuals are awesome.  As an artist, I love the unique design for each character and it matches their personalities.  The backgrounds are clear and detailed.\\n\\nFor the technical, here is a quick summary.  There is no lag.  Transition from room to room is pretty seamless.  Navigation was easy to use.  I only used the English dialogue, so I cant comment on the Japanese.  But I usually find the Japanese voice acting to be awesome in any game.  Anyway, the English voice acting was good and definitely matches well with each character.  There is English subtitles.  It's not fully voiced throughout.  The trial and cut scenes are completely voiced.  At other times, it will be a quick comment from whoever is speaking.  I cant comment on translation from the Japanese either.  Sorry.  There are some extras at the end, but I haven't a chance to explore it yet.\\n\\nGET THIS GAME!  If you like visual novels with puzzle elements, this is for you.  And if you are an Ace Attorney fan, get it.  However, if you are not reader, then pass this one by.  I will like to note there are gruesome murder scenes and foul language for those buying for the children.  I have no regrets with this purchase.  I have already started DangaRonpa 2 and I will eventually go back to get all the bonuses for this game later.  But right now, I got my entertainment worth.  This is an awesome game.   \n",

Gruff, unforgiving but the 'good guy'. Gets a little repetitive and more environmental traps would have been cool. Camera at times is annoying but by no means ruins the game. Boss battles are easy but fun. Overall game is quick to plow through hence why NOW at this price its awesome.   \n",

       "      <td>Puyo Pop Fever is the latest installment of the Puyo Puyo puzzler series and has been revamped with an enhanced game engine that includes the new Fever mode, a larger assortment of characters, and additional modes. The Puyo Puyo series has a long and cryptic history here in the States. While a mainstay for the puzzler genre in Japan, Puyo Puyo has been released in many alternate forms, masking its origins over here. Veteran puzzler gamers will recognize the game engine as the same exact one from the Genesis and Game Gear's Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and the SNES's Kirby's Avalanche. Fever shares a lot with many other puzzler games; Puyo blocks drop down from the screen, and players try to combine four in a row to send a nuisance Puyo over to their opponent until their screen fills up---you can also unleash chain combos for devastating effects. But the new Fever mode adds a definite frantic dimension to the game. During a match, you build up your Fever gauge by eliminating Puyos, and when it's full, you'll enter Fever mode, which gives you a screen full of triple Puyo sets---one well-placed Puyo can set off a unstoppable chain saving you from the brink of disaster or unleashing a fatal blow to your opponent. The only limitation Fever has is that it supports only two players.\\n\\nAdditional enhancements in Fever included larger quadruple Puyo clusters, a 16-character lineup (two of which are unlockable), four courses, Free Battle mode in single player, three default rule settings, the ability to edit rules for versus mode, and three Endless Puyo Pop \"classic\" games. While single-player and Endless Puyo Pop modes are engaging, they can only really be considered training for the Versus mode. When you play against an actual person, the gameplay becomes faster paced and furious. Players must learn to adapt and process enormous amounts of information in a split second, paying attention to their current Puyo pile, the next Puyo piece, their Fever gauge, and their nuisance Puyo bank on the top of the screen. If you don't have any triple Puyo sets on your screen, the nuisance Puyo bank will unleash its contents. This will screw up your screen, and you'll hear the annoying chants of your opponent's character as he buries you. The characters are all well balanced and have varying styles and strategies, and they seem to be well designed to annoy the heck out of you while you play. There's nothing like the feeling of doom as you're fixated on your screen while you here the chants of the opposing character making chain after chain combos. With single, versus, and three endless modes, and 16 available characters, Fever is as addictive as it gets.</td>\n",

Shooting suffers from a timing drag not felt in the original, and the camera positioning hasn't been terribly improved.

The cutscenes are hand drawn still pictures.  The main character -Rau- is difficult to move about and he gets stuck on everything.  Collision detection is terrible.  And as for the \"innovative\" fight controls, it amounts to little more than button mashing. Halfway through the second \"mission\" -walk along and kill everyone you come across- your sword begins to get stuck in something every time you swing it.  Frustrating, dull, and stupid.  I quit.   \n",
       "3308  Puyo Pop Fever is the latest installment of the Puyo Puyo puzzler series and has been revamped with an enhanced game engine that includes the new Fever mode, a larger assortment of characters, and additional modes. The Puyo Puyo series has a long and cryptic history here in the States. While a mainstay for the puzzler genre in Japan, Puyo Puyo has been released in many alternate forms, masking its origins over here. Veteran puzzler gamers will recognize the game engine as the same exact one from the Genesis and Game Gear's Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and the SNES's Kirby's Avalanche. Fever shares a lot with many other puzzler games; Puyo blocks drop down from the screen, and players try to combine four in a row to send a nuisance Puyo over to their opponent until their screen fills up---you can also unleash chain combos for devastating effects. But the new Fever mode adds a definite frantic dimension to the game. During a match, you build up your Fever gauge by eliminating Puyos, and when it's full, you'll enter Fever mode, which gives you a screen full of triple Puyo sets---one well-placed Puyo can set off a unstoppable chain saving you from the brink of disaster or unleashing a fatal blow to your opponent. The only limitation Fever has is that it supports only two players.\\n\\nAdditional enhancements in Fever included larger quadruple Puyo clusters, a 16-character lineup (two of which are unlockable), four courses, Free Battle mode in single player, three default rule settings, the ability to edit rules for versus mode, and three Endless Puyo Pop \"classic\" games. While single-player and Endless Puyo Pop modes are engaging, they can only really be considered training for the Versus mode. When you play against an actual person, the gameplay becomes faster paced and furious. Players must learn to adapt and process enormous amounts of information in a split second, paying attention to their current Puyo pile, the next Puyo piece, their Fever gauge, and their nuisance Puyo bank on the top of the screen. If you don't have any triple Puyo sets on your screen, the nuisance Puyo bank will unleash its contents. This will screw up your screen, and you'll hear the annoying chants of your opponent's character as he buries you. The characters are all well balanced and have varying styles and strategies, and they seem to be well designed to annoy the heck out of you while you play. There's nothing like the feeling of doom as you're fixated on your screen while you here the chants of the opposing character making chain after chain combos. With single, versus, and three endless modes, and 16 available characters, Fever is as addictive as it gets.   \n",

While the graphics are first rate and the franchise option is good and a must in my opinion, the gameplay isn't as flawless as NBA2K2.  Shooting suffers from a timing drag not felt in the original, and the camera positioning hasn't been terribly improved.  I keep hoping for every franchise to make a jump in seamlessness the way they do in graphics and price, but dissapointingly it's not done here.  Still far better than it's competitors, not as surprising and flawless as the football sims.   \n",

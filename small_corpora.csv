These are the people that bought Pes 14, which is possibly the worst soccer game developed. Anything slightly better is five stars. I bought fifa 15, and sold that game in a week. The scripting makes it unplayable. I decided to get pes 15 because of the high expectations, and unfortunately, it sucks just as bad. Defending is broken. The manual says triangle to pressure, but all it does is bring out the goalie. Konami needs to check its content, I guess? So, no idea how to defend, despite practicing. Square doesn't work, and neither does circle. So, I guess I will keep sliding like Im playing NHL. The passing system is inacurate. World class players cannot complete a pass of two yards. Konami, even I complete harder passes than that, and I don't think Im a pro. Then there is the stuttering. Press a button, and you need to wait three seconds before the players react. This is soccer, there should not be a delay. Online play is worse than fifa. Stuttering is common, and when you finish a game, prepare to wait an hour before your next one.
One star is too much for this game. Its basically fifa, without the scripting. We need a new company like 2K sports to enter the soccer market.

Marvel VS Capcom for the PlayStation is an example of one of those 2D fighters that needs to be ditched. But don't get me wrong ! I actually liked the game...on the Dreamcast and arcade. The PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws. Trust me ! This is not arcade perfect ! Most of the times, arcade translations that go to the PlayStation come out imperfect like this one. The graphics are just horrible ! Sure the characters and stages look colorful, but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations, you'll notice that the characters don't move smoothly or move faster. The audio, sounds great. Music tracks and sound effects are brilliant, but nothing special at all. And as for the gameplay, just horrible. And the lack of a tag feature ? Now this is really going overboard ! Just like in Marvel Super Heroes VS Street Fighter for the PlayStation, you have to call up your character to do a one-hit special move. If you want the tag feature, you'll have use the cross over mode, but this feature doesn't emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and Dreamcast versions. The controls could've been slicker, but instead, it ended up choppy. It seems that the PlayStation controller was not meant for great games like this. All in all, the PSX version of Marvel VS Capcom is a big letdown. Choppy animation, choppy controls, lack of a tag feature, and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero. If you want the real Marvel VS Capcom experience, I'd say buy the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version. The DC version of Marvel VS Capcom featured flawless animations, awesome graphics, hyper fast controls, no loading times, and a tag feature. Now that's an arcade perfect translation of one of the best 2D arcade fighters of all time ! The DC version is definently worth the money and worth your time ! Please ! Whatever you do, avoid the PSX version ! This version of Marvel VS Capcom is a disgrace to Capcom's ever expanding lineup of 2D fighters !

That really aught to say it all, but I though I would provide a helpful additional review to those who are willing to risk losing all your previous progress.

Let me start by saying this: If you are going to try to make it through the whole DLC, make about 8 save game copies. You'll need them all and additional luck to beat this DLC. What do I mean? I'm not Bethesda n00b. C'mon, Bethesda practically means game breaking glitch. I had about 4 different save game files when I started Automatron. When I got to the final battle, the game froze forcing me to close the software. I thought ok, this is a short DLC (and it is just as others have stated), I'll start again because this save game is wrecked. Save #2 had the same results. It worked until the final fight, then perma-froze. I almost got through the last time, but it froze none-the-less. I started over again despite being so pissed off that I wanted to sell the game, get a refund from Bethesda, and sell my PS4 (ok not really, but still). Guess what? Save #3 had the exact same result.

As of right now, there is no fix, no work-around, and no solution in sight. I've heard of others with the same problem and it would seem you have about a 50% chance of beating the DLC without encountering this game breaking glitch. You can always just not finish the DLC story, but who wants that? Chances are there may be some future fix, but I approach actually playing this dlc with caution. Assuming you don't actually want to risk it, you can still get a lot of cool stuff from this DLC. Building Robots is awesome.

As the matter of fact there are new uniques, access to a full X-01 suit, and two new locations, but at this point the PS4 release is just too buggy.","Great New Benefits, Awful New Gamebreaking Glitches",1460246400,,"{'Edition:': ' Automatron Add-On', 'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'}",

Because when you first buy this item, you are going to love it.  Give it a year and you are going to do a complete 180 and really dislike this thing.  I loved it and spent a lot of money on games and accessories, and now a year and a half later I am finally getting this wretched piece of electronic negativity out of my home for good.

Right out of the box, your hardware will eventually fail.  The only probability in this equation is the ""when"" component.  I played mine about 1 hour a day.  It lasted 13 months before I received a complete hardware failure.  The second ""refurbished"" unit they sent me didn't ever work, it was broke right out of the box.  The third ""refurb"" they sent me lasted for 2 weeks.  My brothers first unit lasted 2 months, his second was a dead on arrival, he's currently on his third.  I have other friends and this paragraph could go on and on, but to summarize, everyone I know that has owned a 360 has experienced it break.

But the product is unstable, fine.  But that's not all you get out of the 360.  You get to be treated rudely by an obnoxious twenty-something brat everytime you successfully navigate through the obnoxious robot hell that is 1-800-4MY-XBOX.  And you will be calling it a lot.  In fact, that is the only way to cancel your play-to-play online subscription.  Anyone that experienced the AOL-impossible-to-cancel-hotline will feel right at home.

Here's one of my favorites.  You have to pay for everything with ""Microsoft Points"" with are sold in $20 increments.  Want to play the remaining levels in that $59.99 game you just bought?  Not so fast, hotshot.  You need to log into the ""marketplace"" and pay for those last few withheld levels.  Want a new wallpaper?  Nuh uh uh... gotta pay first.  Change your gamertag?  That will be $20 more please.  The nickel and diming gets old really really fast.

But all those things you are buying are ""DRM'd"" to your console.  That means that *only* your console will be able to use downloads.  It's tied to your machine.  But the really cute part is that when your machine breaks, and they send you a refurb... yep, you guessed it.  Nothing works anymore and you get to pay for it all again.  And again.  And again.

My daughter and I have played every Sonic game we could get our hands on.  Some of them are wonderful, some were pretty awful, but THIS is the one I have to tell you about.  In the beginning, I was fascinated by this long, glossy, Final-Fantasy-looking cinematic.  But once the gameplay starts, it's a hideous awful disaster.  This Sonic game doesn't know if it wants to be a role-playing game or a 3D action game, but both are unbearable:  ""missions"" to wander around and figure out who to talk to (there's a ""puzzle"" that has no pattern, for example--you just talk to everybody until one of them coughs up an answer...but he lies to you the first time to make you go around again), and worst of all, levels where you tear along at a high rate of speed, and then plant face-first into death.  Touch the controls and screw everything up.  Don't touch the contols, and screw everything up.  If I tried to make a video of the gameplay, it'd be an endless montage of death after death, many of which you don't even know what you did wrong.

I'll keep this as concise as possible... whether you are a Lost fan or not, don't buy this game for any more than $5.  I can honestly say if I were not a Lost fan and just looking for an adventure game, or even thinking I am interested in getting into Lost, it does not possess the quality to stand on its own (or even with the Lost title boosting it) as a good game.

The gameplay was choppy, linear and convoluted. Any time you traveled into the forest you CONSTANTLY had to hide in the banyan trees to avoid the smoke monster.  This happened ALL THE TIME and also make you lose track of where you were, making any trip through the trees an extremely frustrating journey.  And how much fun is being on an island without really exploring the beach, the jungle, the various landmarks around the island at free will?

It's like you're put in a lush, enormous castle with 150 rooms, but you are only allowed to walk down the hallways, and once in a while, glance into a couple rooms along the way and wish you could go in there.

As far as the plot, I thought it was as original as they could make it, given the situation.  How do you introduce a new character on an island full of people all on the same plane?  At least it was somewhat convincing.  Add to that some Lost-worthy flashback action, and you almost have a game going here.

And just as it starts to come together (which is frustratingly quickly), the game ends.  With, I might add, an interesting and very Lost-like twist, but nothing makes up for how boring the game is.

Scenery and graphics, and (at least the attempt at) an original plot line, Lost: Via Domus gets a 5/5.  I do give props on the effort to replicate the scenery, again, something that was done splendidly and just added to my intense disappointment of failure in almost every OTHER aspect of the game.

The controls aren't well designed, partly because the game is mainly set in 2-D, but is also 3-D whenever it is most inconvenient. You are controlling a fleet of ships, but the controls aren't up to the task of controlling individual ships (which is frequently necessary). Commands to individual ships are often mysteriously forgotten. The A.I. for both the enemies and your own ships is quite poor. Tedious micromanaging is the norm.

The main voice acting is merely decent, while the secondary voice acting is dreadful due in no small part to muddled accents (father was Russian and mother was Scottish?). Even worse, dialog during combat is actively misleading with lines such as ""shields are down, captain!"" when all ships' shields are actually fine.

The space battles are dull affairs as you have so little control over the single ship you are managing at any given moment. On top of that, there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to the effectiveness of the weapons and shields. On many occasions I've found it necessary to retreat from an enemy who had hammered my ships, only to repair and return and find that same enemy is suddenly ridiculously weak and easy to destory.

Even at the ""easy"" setting, the difficulty of this game has nothing to do with the actual gameplay and everything to do with the how well or how poorly the mission is crafted to the controls and how random are the spawned enemy (be they ships, or asteroids, or even timed events). More than one mission (and you cannot skip a mission) is nothing more than tedious hours of repeating the mission until you are lucky enough to overcome the objectives.

Zack & Wiki is a puzzle/adventure game with a heavy anime flavor; although the tiny amount of voice acting is in English, it's obvious that the actors are speaking their lines phonetically (""Sea Rabbits"" becomes ""See-Rabito,"" for instance).  Not that I mind, except that it's sort of incongruous with the written dialogue.  Other reviews have compared the gameplay to old-fashioned point-and-click adventures, but honestly, I don't think I would have made that connection if I hadn't read it beforehand; there are inventory items, but you don't keep them from one level to the next, and there's almost no plot to speak of.

To be fair, there are good things about the game; it's certainly original, and aside from the issue with the voice acting, the characters are pretty endearing; Zack's facial expressions are a hoot, and Captain Rose is adorable, in her anime-girl way.

Unfortunately, the thing that cripples Zack & Wiki is the gameplay itself.  The designers made it possible to die, for instance; that wouldn't bug me, except that way too often, the thing that kills you is something that you never in a million years would have seen coming unless you either worked on the design team or you possess the gift of second sight.  (Occasionally, especially in the ""Flute of the Growlin' Goblins"" level, the thing that kills you is the Wiimote misinterpreting the motion you're trying to make, or not make; in this level, there's a crank-operated gondola thing that sometimes keeps going even when you've stopped flailing your Wiimote.)  What's worse, the game seems intent on punishing you, and punishing you dearly, whenever you do get killed; not only do you lose all of your money and points, but unless you've got an expensive ""platinum ticket,"" you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the level.  There's a hints system, but not only are the hints even more expensive than the platinum tickets, they seem to have no bearing on the progress you've made; if you've made it halfway through the level and you buy a hint, you'll most likely be told something that you figured out for yourself twenty minutes ago.  (Plus, as you already know if you're reading this, we have an ""internet"" nowadays; why screw around with in-game hints when you can get all the hints you need from GameFAQs or any of a million other places?  I'd maybe understand if Zack & Wiki was made back when there was no internet to be had, but the thing's only a year old.  It's especially dumb when you realize that you can access that very same internet right from your Wii.)  And yeah, you can go back and replay levels to recoup your losses if you want, but why not make it reasonably possible to get through them on the first try instead of artificially lengthening the gameplay by making you repeat everything?

To be honest, I have no idea who the designers had in mind with this one; the overall tone suggests they intended the game for younger players, but I'm a full-grown adult and I can't even get through more than five minutes with my sanity intact.  I haven't beaten the game yet, and I'll probably keep trying, but at this point, it's more like a vendetta than anything else.  (Plus, it seems a shame to waste the money I spent on it, although I have a feeling that ship has already sailed.)  I should point out also that I totally saw the ""plot twist"" coming.

I'm 61; female; never played video games in my life & never have been at all interested.  My grown sons guffawed at my Nintendo DS purchase.  In my defense, I bought it for Brain Age 1&2....  And then thought it would be perfect for long trans-con flights - - if I could find some ""adult"" kinds of games that didn't involve blowing up cars or hopping across rivers & avoiding alligators.

I was sure that SO would be the answer.  It would have a gazillion different solitaire games!  Hot doggies!  This would be the entire family of the famous game we all play while on telephone hold, right?

Well, sort of.

This software is just ok.

SO suffers most from lack of instructions, which I feel are important, especially since solitaire games are very similar to each other.  I finally got out my Hoyle book and another card game book for instructions on how to play these games!  (There are no instructions in the dox.  Altho there are some onboard for each game, they're pretty obscure.  As I said, I got out my Hoyle to help me understand the onboard directions!  Really, now, one shouldn't have to consult another source to play the game.  Really lacking on the consumer support!)

I'd like to be able to search by game type, but this does not appear to be possible, despite the ""search"" feature.

""Slider"" down R side of screen is so sensitive as to be almost uncontrollable.  (If you hate shopping carts that won't steer, you'll hate this failure, too!)

Positives:  User may change wallpapers, choose music (including a shuffle option), and change card reverse pic.  Resolution is sharp in the wallpapers.  The cards themselves are a little hard to read, but it's a very small image!

Still and all, there are a lot of negatives, so I decided to keep looking.

Stop here if you don't want to read about the game I found and love!

As long as I was hunting again, I decided I wanted something that had more game variety than just solitaire card games (which is why CG had looked so attractive).

If I had known about ""TouchMaster,""  I wouldn't have bothered with SO at all!

TM has plenty of games for the solo player, including several card solitaires.  In addition to very good, concise on-screen instructions, there are instructions for each game in the liner notes in the case (yay!) that are well-written and lucid.

Has a wheel-of-fortune type (this has only 6 categories, alas, so repetition happens pretty quickly), word search, etc.  Several card games will help you brush up your 11, 13, and 21 addition facts.  Some games are strictly chance; others involve varying amounts of skill and strategy.  You can read elsewhere in detail about the content.

All games are stylus-activated.  A big plus.

I must have spent 6 hours with this software tonight.  (Yes, I should have been grinding on my lengthy to-do list, but I just couldn't resist.  I'll probably play some more after I finish this review!)

For the record: because I wanted to like this game so much I gave it two complete play-throughs with different character types, different play-styles, and on different difficulties. Yes, it was difficult to play so much of a game that I eventually ended-up despising, but I had such high hopes for this series (mostly because of Dragon Age: Origins and my history with BioWare) that I had to be sure I was giving the game a fair shake.

If you liked Dragon Age: Origins -- stay away from this game; it has none of the attention to detail, none of the sense of grandeur, and certainly much less of a heart than it's predecessor. (Well, the graphics are ""better"" in DA2, but Origins managed to keep my interest regardless of its slightly-less-than-amazing graphics; the ""more polished"" look of DA2 was not enough to keep my interest.)

If you liked Mass Effect 2: stick to that series of games; DA2 is not a ""fantasy"" version of Mass Effect 2, and is merely borrowing some mechanics and awkwardly thrusting them into what was already a successful (and vastly different) series.

If you're a BioWare fan because of Baldur's Gate and related games (like me), then there is little for you to love in Dragon Age 2.

If you want to know why this game is so terrible (in a mechanical way, and not speaking about the fact that it's a half-hearted, rushed, big-corporate-production aimed at cashing-in on the success of it's predecessor) then read some of the other reviews here on Amazon, click over to MetaCritic and read the USER reviews, and visit the official BioWare forums.

BioWare fans: you have been wronged, and the world of video games has another artless plastic box taking-up shelf space all over the world.

The game world has several examples of what happens when developers do a rushed, half-hearted job because of responses to ""marketing analysis"" and pressure from the publisher; ""Ultima 9"" and ""Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within"" were always my two favorite examples, but Dragon Age 2 is getting added to that list.",I'm tired of writing about how disappointed I am...,1318118400,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

Then your browser, the one with the non-optional plugin you were forced to install, boots up and takes you to the website. In game browser? No, that would not eat up nearly enough resources or be nearly as invasive! So you get in there. Let's say you just want to play the single player game.

Meaning if you ever doubted for just a moment that Eiji Aonuma was a horrible videogame director/creator/producer THIS is the game that should change your mind about that.

Majora's Mask's game world and design utterly radiates Aonuma's total lack of charisma and incompetence throughout.

From the goofy stupid moon above (which Aonuma/Nintendo fan lemmings constantly scream is ""OMG MATURE AND DARK!!111!!"") to the obnoxiously nasty remixed music of The Legend Of  Zelda: A Link To The Past's overworld theme this Aonuma Zelda offering, (the first of far too many) began the viscious cycle of Aonuma becoming the turd in The Legend Of Zelda's proverbial punch bowl and thus the Zelda series began it's steep decline in sales as it slides down Aonuma's creativity colon into the commode known as the bomba bin, where it then is flushed and deposited in the septic sewer of unsustainability.

This game is the penultimate game for non entities and Aonuma's fellow traveller charisma deficients to cling on to and claim is oh so great in a pathetic attempt to make themselves look artsy, edgy and cultured as a result because *wink wink* reader, they know something about Majora's Mask that WE don't know...or so their asperger's syndrome/autism addled minds makes them think.

Yes indeed followers, lemmings and mental defectives are Majora's Masks main audience ie hipsters, liberal geldings, guys who get barb wire tattoos on their biceps because they think it makes them look tough etc. THOSE are the kind of weirdos that are drawn to defending Majora's Mask on gaming forums and making it out like it is the second coming when all it is in reality is Eiji Aonuma's second attempt at playing game designer.

Well his first attempt with ""Marvelous"" failed abysmally and his constant inability to learn his lesson (and quit while he's ahead) has unsurprisingly resulted in another sales bomb for him with this trash known as Majora's Mask which I am reviewing for you Amazon's game customers now.

The internet lames petition to have Majora's Mask made into a 3DS game has predictably and utterly (not to mention gloriously) failed because Nintendo knows what I know and that is Majora's Mask was a dud when it originally launched thus its not like its suddenly going to light the world on fire if it's re-released now.

Oh the Nintendo fan lemmings and Nintendo damage controllists continually make their excuses for why the game failed ie they'll say that it failed because it was released at the end of the Nintendo 64's lifespan and required an add on to work, etc.

Yet the truth of the matter is the game failed because it was a different game altogether than a Legend Of Zelda game.

It was a completely different game that simply featured Link, the setting was uninspiring and the NPC's were bad as is typical of Aonuma Zelda games.

The Nintendo fanboy excuses for why Majora's Mask failed don't hold water because a truly epic game, a game that creates a phenomenon like the original Super Mario Brothers, Halo or Ocarina Of Time for example...it wouldn't matter if such games were released at the end of a console's lifespan, or if they needed an add on or both, fans would move both heaven and earth to secure their copy and get whatever add on they needed to be able to play it.

Thats the kind of motivating power true gaming phenomenon's possess and Majora's Mask just didn't have it because it wasn't the game the true Zelda fanbase were looking for at the time which was a true genuine sequel to Ocarina Of Time.

People argue and even Nintendo says that Majora's Mask was a sequel to Ocarina Of Time as it used child Link from Ocarina Of Time but these damage controllists and Nintendo simply do not get it, get what people wanted out of a sequel to a game like Ocarina Of Time.

We wanted a game that continued the sandbox/open world exploration of Hyrule and it's themes and lore, a non linear game world featuring Hyrule's forests, fields and rivers, lakes and lost woods, Ganon, Zelda, Gorons and the whole nine yards of what the true Zelda experience entails, just even more epic than Ocarina Of Time's experience was due to the idea that Nintendo would learn something about creating midieval sword and sorcery fantasy adventure epics that feel so good to play they are damn near like having a religious experience and we'd think they'd of learned as much from having made Ocarina Of Time, Link To The Past and even the very first Zelda game on the NES but NOOOOO!!!!

Nintendo had to put Aonuma in charge of Zelda instead of who they should have that being Kozuimi and because of that this effeminate geek/dweeb non entity hack Jimmy Fallon of Japan, pretentious, egg headed, left brained high IQ beta male whose never gone on an adventure or taken any big risks in life who can't identify with regular everyday normal people has just got to prove his worth and show us just how ""creative"" he can be by using the Legend Of Zelda IP to vomit out his second modern art/art house flop disaster Major Embarassment...oops I meant Majora's Mask...(or did I?)

And the result just like his first game ""Marvelous"" was a sales flop.

NO SURPRISE THERE!

Anyway Ocarina Of Time fans wanted Nintendo to take things to the next level instead of giving us garbage like the world of Termina and it's boring circular field and its incredibly boring and lame Clock town and a boring goofy looking totally non threatening moon overhead and a closet homosexual manchild named Tingle to mock true Zelda fans with as Kojima mocked Metal Gear Solid fans in a similar but far less offensive way with Raiden.

Nintendo please for sanity's sake fire this guy already or if you can't bring yourself to firing Eiji Aonuma at least switch his role in the company to something that'd be more befitting his skill-set which in other words means he should be cleaning the corporate toilets or bringing donuts and coffee to people, if not rice and octupus (whatever corporate types in Japan prefer for breakfast).",The game that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Eiji Aonuma was a hack no talent Jimmy Fallon of Japan,1388707200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Nothing they said during their interviews was true, game play is VERY linear.

You will be playing the same strike missions over and over with slightly higher level enemies and Crucible is just a unbalanced mess were level does matter.
 They stated in the interview that level advantages won't exist in crucible so that a level 15 player can compete with a level 25 but that was a total lie. I am currently at level 22 and when i face anyone below 20 they are just no match and this is because the weapons you pick up at over 20 have much better specs. Ya they lowered the damage points but what about all the other aspects of the gun? Nope still the same. Also you are not guaranteed a match item for coming first in a match, I actually discovered that if you sit down during a match and just let other players beat the snot out of you, you have the same chance at getting a match item as the person who came in first. So why try?

The environments are pretty small and the edge is not clearly defined which has led to many deaths during gameplay. Exploring is boring since it usually doesn't pay off.

Like i mention before I am currently at level 22 which is greater than the level cap at 20 which means my level is based on the items I mount. So far only items classified as rare and above will give you ""light"" which is needed to level up and now playing regular missions has become pointless since those missions basically only yield uncommon and below items.

This game was such a let down that I decided to pick up Battlefield 4 and just play this when ever i want to play Halo (which was 100x's better).

I will say this though, it is still early in this games life and events are scheduled to happen so I might change my review but as of right now I don't recommend this game.

Update 10/10/14
I have basically stopped playing because of how unbalanced gameplay is. I re-made a new character using a hunter and was amazed at how dominant this class is in crucible (which is basically the only game mode that isn't boring) and decided that this game was crap and not worth playing.

Ensure there is no damage to it, or the braided cable, and plug it into your PC to ensure it works as well. You're paying a good $60 (Lowest price its been to date)-$80 bucks for this mouse, so you should expect it to be free of flaws and defects, but this mouse was nothing but flawed. This is not a knock against Corsair. I love their quality products - but the Black Corsair Gaming SCIMITAR MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse has some serious quality control issues. The mouse itself feels great, and the macros are as well, but quality wise? Corsair needs to honestly take a better look at how these mice are made.

The first mouse I received had an issue with the right clicker. Okay, maybe I was unlucky, I requested a replacement.

The second one had an issue with the wheel (Loud, clunky noises), braided cable seemed as if it was picked at slightly, and area where the cable and mouse looked as if it was not fully sealed/attached, compared to the first one.

Alright, I'm just really unlucky - I requested another replacement.

You'd think the third's time the charm, correct? The 3rd one looked 'okay,' aside from button #11 protruding out more than the rest, but then I unwrapped the cable, and noticed the braided cable had massive damage on it, about 3 or so giant, pointy hard things coming out of it. What is wrong with these mice?

After speaking with Amazon, I had the option to either get a refund, or try a replacement. Because of Corsair's reputation for quality products, I chose to try one last replacement and promised myself that it would be the last one. At this point, I'm starting to think all the planets must have been aligned in order for such bad luck to happen.

So the 4th one would surely be okay, right? Somewhat. The right side, above the side keypad - it looks like it was carved at/sliced. I can live with it - It's fine since it's just cosmetic damage, but I shouldn't have had issues with all 4 mice. It's really upsetting.

I'm keeping one, due to its great feel and uses, but I'm really disappointed in Corsair and their lack of Quality Control for this mouse. I do not know if this is the case for the Yellow version of this mouse.

Overall, please do not let this steer you away from Corsair products, as their keyboards are nothing BUT amazing - But that's a different review.

It's small, doesn't require an outlet to charge like most other chargers, can charge two at one time, has a light on the front to indicate it's charging, and is totally wireless. The two chargers on the back are also a huge plus.
There's really only one big negative, and it has to be that I always feel like it's going to break. It feels cheaply made, its constantly getting knocked off center by my cats, me, my dogs tails, anything. I feel like the USB ports are going to snap off inside. It just feels flimsy. I can't complain too much as I only paid about $7, but iafter only a few hours of using it, all I can think about is how the USB ports are going to break. The charging ports aren't very deep either and something is constantly bumping my controller off the charging station. My cats like to lay near/on top of my PlayStation because it's so warm so that's why they're always hitting it.

To start, for a flying game to be any good you must first get some sense that you are flying.  Aero elite seemed to go out of its way to take that sense from you.  For perspective, I would say that Ace Combat 4 gives you a far better sense of flying.  While that game was not terribly realistic in that your plane could hold 50-70 missles, it is in every other way a far superior game and would give it 3.5 to 4.0 stars.
Aero elite's graphics are Ok nothing great and certainly no better that Ace Combat 4's.  The controls are horrendous, from accelerating to decelerating, to the firing of missles, to just flying the plane around the screen.
There is a great selection of planes, however, It's no fun to fly any of them because it doesn't feel like your flying any of them.

For instance in the last mission I played (before uninstalling it and throwing it away) I was supposed to pick up a container, protect my  mothership by fending off the attacking tie fighters and fly to a  checkpoint to meet the rebellion.  So I picked up the container and started  killing off tie fighters.  I got them all.  I was killing them as fast as  they were replaced.  Then I got slammed with a dozen missles from all sides  and lost the mission.  I never got notification to go to the next  checkpoint.  The game has a help function after you lose a mission that  gives tips on how to win the mission the next time.  The tip?  Don't  protect the mothership.  The checkpoint won't appear until the mothership  is destroyed.  Besides, if you attack the tie-fighters, then your container  will get destroyed and you won't be able to finish the mission.  That might  be okay, except that the game doesn't tell you that you can't complete the  mission.  Once I just sat there for 10 minutes waiting for something to  happen.  That was boring. After four hours of finding out that I was  supposed to ignore mission objectives and do very little I uninstalled the  game and threw it away.

I don't go out and buy the next installment of FF (after VIII, it really got bad imo), I enjoyed .hack and its storyline though (but I felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with FFVII). Then there is the PE video game, I loved the first one, had some trouble, but over all it was a great game. I knew there was a part 2, so I found a copy and started playing it. Boy...was I disappointed.

 First, the game play is terrible, the movement is haphazard, the angles are horrific, and its down right troublesome (unlike the first one). I loathed the movement, there was none of the smoothness of the first one.

 Second, I hated the leveling, what leveling there is. You don't go up in your hit points, you barely go up in MPs and parasite powers, and even worse, when you go to a next scene (from one point to the next in the story) you go back down to your 100 hit points.

 Third, which is related to the angles, the combat is atrocious. There is nothing quick and exciting, in fact its down right stressful because (since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend ""money"" between the scenes at home base) you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe 1 hit point left and then WHAM you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again. Even worse, the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindly.

 Fourth, connected to three, the weapons are horrible to use. You end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents (unlike the smoothness of the original first story) and you're going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situation.

 Fifth, items, with the original first game, you got lots and lots of items. With this game, you are in luck if after three or four attacks (bringing you down to 1 hit point) you finally strike it and get a recovery2 pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat round.

 While the story line might be interesting, it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means, the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you don't care how this story ends. Its a bad, bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original game's beauty. Dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicine.

So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!

MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, ""hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?""

The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to ""Sell-Sell!-SELL!!"" instead of posting this...

Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with ""fighting piracy"". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.
That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.

Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.

And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.

The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games ""protected"" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly ""protected"" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!
To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.

1. It doesn't actually involve any of the recognizable ships or characters from the Star Trek shows. It doesn't say that it does, I think, but it seems like it would have been smarter of them to use something people would recognize.
2. It advertises that you can play various races, which, at least for me, set up the expectation that at the beginning of the game you'd get to do some sort of character creation, choosing your race and such. I can only assume the different playable races come into it later in the game. In the beginning, you get no choice of who your character is or what faction. You are a white male human, and that's it. You don't even get to choose a name.
3. The controls were bad. Just very bad. It's very difficult to get your ship into the position you need to in order to attack the enemy ships. And I don't even know how you're supposed to fire at them. There are two buttons (one for phasers, one for torpedoes), but they have to recharge or something between shots. I think the game briefly said that there's a bar to let you know when it's ready to go again, but I could never see it. I got into one fight with three enemy ships, and despite constantly pressing both buttons, my ship didn't fire a single shot. It just floated around (because, like I said, ship control is very poor) and got hit until it blew up.
4. The one thing I liked was the conversation options which allow you some control over how the game goes. But, as with most games were this sort of thing is an option, you still end up fighting whether or not you try to use a more diplomatic option.
5. Being as I'm familiar with the Star Trek universe to a pretty decent degree, I didn't find that the fighting style in this game actually resembled starship fighting as portrayed in the movies/shows at all.

I have not played many Star Trek games, so I'm judging this as a fan of Star Trek and, to a lesser degree, of video games in general. This game fails by every measure I can apply to it.

If you have played DOOM 3, then you have already played Quake 4!

I was wondering why this game slipped out onto store shelves and was released to retail without any great fanfare. Now I know why! It is basically the new Doom, except the weapons have flashlights. I am not impressed at all. I beat this game on the hardest setting no problem. The enemies are not particularly clever, just greater in number. Talk about predictable...this game was that in spades. Sadly, you can finish this game in 10 hours or less....YUCK!

Quake 4 is built by the same team using the same graphics engine. I didn't like DOOM 3 much either but it was a great deal better than this. Yes, the graphics were average. I have a AMD 64bit 4000+, an NVIDIA 7800 256MB GTX, 2 sticks of Corsair 1GB 3200 DDR modules, and a Viewsonic 19 inch VP191b monitor. And with all that power, and with Quake 4 video settings cranked up to the highest settings...it still was rough and mediocre looking!! However, the Quake series was never known for its stunning graphics and beauty. Mainly, I felt there was nothing hard to accomplish or figure out. Basically this game did not fill the 1st person shooter void within me. I am a huge fan of id software and have played every Doom or Quake title they ever released, when they were originally released. Yes, I have been playing computer games since my old Commodore 64 was delivered!!!

This is just my opinion though. Download a demo version and give it a whirl but I doubt you will want to pay $50 for it.

That said, I bet multiplayer on this will be a blast after some MODs are created and released. I have hosted 5 different lan parties for this game and we yawned through it until we gave up and switched over to Battlefield 2 or UT 2004! MUCH BETTER MP ACTION!!!!

In summation -

Enemy AI is lame, graphics are weak, a few cool ""factory"" scenes but no reason to go crazy for this title, gameplay is predictable, weapons are mediocre, limited interactive environment, nothing thrilling, exciting or shocking that will keep your tension levels cranked up to 11.

Half-Life 2, Battlefield 2, UT 2004, GTA: San Andreas even the older and outdated Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games will keep you stressed and excited better than Quake 4.

Save your money...spend it on Call Of Duty 2, which comes out this week anyway! F.E.A.R. is already out, PREY is coming out soon. Much better uses of $50",A DOOM 3 repeat...nothing new !!!,1130198400,,,

RE 4 had already been disappointing some years ago, with all that action and no puzzles and shock moments implented anymore.
Well, and after playing the RE 5 Demo several times, here are my first impressions:

- an UNBELIEVABLE LONG loading time. I actually went to the bathroom, got me something to drink, checked my mails, then I got to play. That really has to change until the launch of the game, but i doubt it.
- chrashed several times, very unstable. hopefully that is just an error as to the demo and not the full game.
- graphics are really stunning as to the sourroundings (africa in far cry 2 looked better, but it is still great) and characters. the zombies look kinda weird. and after you killed them they disappear in some sort of bubbles, looked like house of the dead, looked really silly.
- the BIGGEST flaw: this DAMN CO-OP mode!!! Don'T get me wrong, playing co-op with a friend is kewl, although the splitscreen was implented in a weird way in the corners of the screen, but okay. but if you are a solo player you are stuck with your miserable A.I. partner that ALWAYS runs in front of you, around you, 2cm away from your nose like a bee anxious to get some honey. it is SOO annoying. and it does not matter in the least if you are doing everything the right way, meaning giving her ammunition, herbs, covering, etc, she dies, and THAT happens a lot. And THAT means: GAME OVER!!! I want to play RE, I want to die and I want to finish the game with MY skills, not with some screwed up A.I. figure that can'T even walk right.
- the sound is okay as long as you just focus on the surroundings and the zombie sounds. the weapon sounds are some of the lamest sounds I have EVER heard in a game.
- Difficulty: well, the past RE games have always been easy in the beginning and sometimes got really hard during the game and especially in the end with defeating the final boss. but now: SINCE WHEN does a zombie NOT DIE when you shot him directly in the head? with your pistol u have to shoot at last 2 times in the head or 4-5 at the body of the zombie to kill him. and considering that you got much less ammo than EVER in a RE game this is pretty annoying.

Overall I am very very angry, sad and disappointed and immediately cancelled my pre-order. First I wanna see how the final game looks like and which of those flaws have been erased, but I fear there won't be much done about it. If it costs 10 some time in the future I guess you can buy it.

The game begins with Tyris walking through a barren valley by herself and realizing she's late for a huge ceremony where her Dragon God flies down from the sky and blesses her people.  She realizes that being late for this is probably a bad thing and starts to run, but encounters orc-like creatures called, ""BOOGEYMEN.""  Seriously, that's that they're called.  She battles her way through the BOOGEYMEN and arrives at the ceremony too late.  A group of BOOGEYMEN kill all of the priestesses, knock Tyris out, and kidnap her all mighty Dragon God.
- If your Dragon God gets kidnapped by a band of Orcs, it's time to get a new God.

Later Tyris awakens and the dwarf from the original game is there, pulling an axe out of his chest.  He sees Tyris and exclaims, ""By my balls, I thought you were dead.""  Ok, if you're a hot chick who was unconscious and the first thing you hear is a dwarf talking about his testicles, that's not a good thing.  Maybe he's saying he resurrected you somehow with his balls, or he is your father, or maybe that's just a contemporary Dwarven expression.  Anyway, the Dwarf gives Tyris an axe and says you must find the pieces and reassemble it.  Lucky for Tyris, the pieces just snap on.  Near the end of the game, Axe Battler from the original game appears and says something like, ""Gee, Tyris, I'm sorry your game sucks so bad.  See Ya,"" and he's gone.  I think there are 30 lines of bad dialogue in the entire story.

Gameplay  - 1/10
In this day and age, developers of real games put the player in an adventure and let them battle their way through it.  Golden Axe puts the player in a world and punishes them if they don't do what the designers intended.  No attempt is made to make a cohesive world.  Instead, the game just stops from time to time and says, ""Challenge Complete"" and gives you a score, usually telling you that you suck.  If you die during a Challenge, you have a LIMITED NUMBER OF CONTINUES that you can use or you must start over.  The game also makes every attempt to take cheap shots at the player:  Bombs hidden in objectives, poison hidden in chests, near impossible jumps...

Controls - 1/10
The controls are very awkward at best.
A - Jump, B - Mount Beast, X - Light Attack, Y - Heavy Attack, RB - Parry, LB - Evade, D-Pad - Choose Magic, L Trigger - Run, R Trigger - Magic, X+Y = Knockback Attack.
Combat relies heavily on pressing RB, LB, and X+Y.  Where do you put your hands to press RB, then X+Y immediately after that?!

Combat - 2/10
You begin AND END the game with 2 combos.  XXX for multiple enemies.  YYY to do damage to a single enemy.  If you delay your presses, you deal extra damage.  You can mix and match the X's and Y's, but there's no point.  You can't get new moves or new weapon types, so you'd better love pressing XXX or YYY.
Most of the focus of combat is on Defense, which is a lot less fun than thinking about slaughtering enemies.  There is NO BLOCK in the game.
Tyris can Parry or Evade.  The enemy attacks are color coded.  Orange Attacks can be Evaded, Blue can be parried.  If you are successful, you can counter attack for extra damage.  If you try to Parry a Blue or Evade an Orange, Tyris just stands there and gets beaten up.  If no attacks are coming at you, THE BUTTONS DO NOTHING AND YOU ARE IMMOBILE FOR 2 SECONDS.  If you are attacking, the Parry and Evade don't take effect until the animation ends, so the best way to fight is to stand still, Parry or Evade, then attack.  Boy, I bet you can't wait to experience that!  There is no combat manager in the game, so Tyris can be attacked by a Blue and Orange at the same time, which means you get hit and lose your bonus.  This reminds Tyris that the world is cruel and unfair.

Beasts - 3/10
Beasts are only in the game about 10% of the time.  The beasts are sluggish and clunky and they only have 3 attacks each.  X, Y, and X+Y.  In some cases, using the X+Y attack drains the beast's health.  The beasts are disposable and if Tyris gets knocked off a beast, the weakest enemy can jump on it and ride it, to remind her that she is not special.

Leveling Up - 0/10
At the end of each challenge, you accumulate Gold.  If you defend well, you get a bonus to the gold that you pick up.  If you get hit once, the bonus drops to zero.  This is very frustrating.  When you complete a level, you get graded based on damage taken, gold, time, and dismemberment.  If you play on NORMAL MODE, the game multiplies your gold by 1/3!!!!!!  You only keep 1/3 of your GOLD!!!  The background for this screen should have been a giant middle finger!  (Hard Mode is x1)
Getting gold, fills a bar at the bottom of the screen.  When that fills up, you get what the game decides to give you.  You usually get a new outfit for Tyris that looks the same as the one she already has.  This reminds Tyris that no matter how hard she tries, she will never get ahead in the world.

Level Design - 0/10
Every level looks the same.  From the rocky barren plains, to the dusty barren plains dotted with ruins.  In every level, there are spikes that randomly pop in and out of the ground for no apparent reason.  Absolutely no attempt is made to make this look like a world.  Instead the levels are there to take cheap shots at Tyris.  In some levels, while riding a dinosaur, the wind can blow you and the dino off of the cliff.
Opening doors is incredibly confusing.  There are 9 different ways to open doors, but there is only 1 way to open each door, and you never really know how you are supposed to open them.
If you ever get lost, the best way to tell if you are headed in the right direction is the slow down.  The game drops frames to load in enemies.  So, if the game suddenly pauses for a second, that's a good thing.  There are invisible walls everywhere, so the levels may look like mass expanses of dirt, but they're linear dirt trails surrounded by dirt.

Bosses 1/10
Almost all the bosses are the same guy.  It's a 60 foot tall giant that you attack.  After you hit him a few times, he crouches.  When he crouches, Tyris kicks him and he goes flying backwards into a fire column to take damage.  If Tyris can move a 60 foot tall giant with a kick, why can't she jump more than 5 feet?  Perhaps the bosses are made of helium.

Bugs - 10/10
I've seen Tyris get stuck in level geometry.  I've seen the game crash.  I've heard the sound skip.  I've seen Tyris fall out of the world.  There are render tears and slowdown.  I've also seen an entire palette shift to blue.

Sound - 5/10
The music is ok, but neither feels epic nor atmospheric.

The Ending - 0/10
Tyris catches up with her captured Dragon God and he tells her the final piece of the axe is his soul.  She stabs him in the head and does her best Darth Vader Episode 3, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""  I laughed for a minute.  Then you fight Death Adder.  The fight is 20 minutes long and makes no sense.  But, that's ok because the fight pauses every few minutes and pop-up windows appear giving you detalied instructions on what you are supposed to be doing.  Hit him, ride him, make him destroy some statues, then a cutscene plays where Death Adder says, ""Fool, I will destroy you!""  Tyris replies, ""Maybe, but not this day!""  Seriously, that's what she says.  She chops his head off.  Your reward...  a skimpy white bikini costume.  So, the final scene plays and the Dwarf and Axe are there.  Tyris says, ""I've lost my land, my god, my people...""  But it's hard to take her seriously because she looks like `Fun in the Sun' Tyris who's about to go play beach volleyball and drink something with a little umbrella in it.  Axe Battler says, ""This is just the beginning.""  The dwarf starts to talk, but is abruptly cut off by the credits.  That's right, the credits interrupt the last cutscene.

The game is rated M for violence, gore, and nudity.  Unfortunately, the nudity is only on dead, charred, or dismembered bodies.  If you're going to put breasts in a game, put them on living women so the non-necrophiliacs can enjoy them, too.

If you're dying to play a hack and slash game, you should play Ninja Gaiden 2, Devil May Cry 4, Oblivion, Too Human, Viking, The Force Unleashed, Lego Star Wars, Assassin's Creed... then buy a Wii and play Zelda and No More Heroes... then buy Castle Crashers on the Xbox Marketplace... You're better off avoiding this game.

If you feel you must play it, it's only 6-8 hours long and not very difficult.

I have a level 25 character in Fallout New Vegas. For the first few days I played the game I had no problems with any major bugs. Sure there were the floating objects and NPCs stuck in walls, the ground, etc and there were some scripting issues with dialog but hey this game is awesome, who cares! And then the game started to have problems with it pausing for a second or two. It wouldn't freeze, it would just pretend to freeze then be fine. Hey I can deal with that. And then it happened, less than a week into playing the game crashed, and at that point I knew I had made a mistake in purchasing this title.

Since then, it has been downhill. I try to play for two to three hours a session, and the last ten sessions have ended prematurely with the game freezing, forcing me to do a hard reset on my PS3. Last night in fact, it froze after about 45 minutes of game play. I decided to reboot and keep going but only got another hour in before it froze again.

Its not just the freezes - though they are infuriating when you've traversed across the open wasteland for a long time only to have the game freeze - its the combination of all the issues. I've had problems with several quests becoming bugged where I am unable to complete them. Sometimes dialog options do not show up that should (confirmed by looking up the quest solutions online when I got stuck). For one quest, I've done everything I'm supposed to and only have to talk to one NPC to get my reward - but the NPC is bugged and won't talk to me!

What pains me the most about having to give this game 1 star is that when the game is working fine its fabulous RPG Fallout action. It is an incredibly entertaining game. However, given the frequent freezes, quest glitches, and pauses the game is no longer fun. I'm constantly having to save due to the risk that the game will freeze and force me to replay sections. The pauses make me anxious that the game is frozen, taking me out of the moment playing - I'm not engrossed in the game because I'm worried it will freeze.

And don't even get me started on the load times, sometimes I feel like in an hour of gaming I spent the majority of the time waiting for the next section to load (an exaggeration of course but the load times are horrendous).

All in all, if they patch the game to not freeze, pause, take so long to load constantly, glitch quests and NPC dialog then this would have gotten 4 stars easily. Buyer beware, frustration lies ahead.",Amazing when it works,1289865600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,False,"04 8, 2012",A2YRK2XNXALLKQ,B0009Z3MQK,T-ACCT,"I loved the game when I was 10 years old. Then I loaned it to my autistic brother (8 yrs old), and it seemed like a good idea.
I thought that making freinds with animals could really help his social skills, and he really liked the Wii version. However, he
did not know how to save on my DSi so he just cut it off. Every time you ""reset"" the game, a mole named Resetti comes out
to lecture you. I never really cared much about what he made ME do, but he made my AUTISTIC brother type in
""I am a loser.""! His therapy instructor is currently working to teach him not to say things like that, and then one of Nintendo's
stupid characters forced him to type negative stuff in! This game could have been a major step for him and me, but now I'm getting my copy back.

And here is what I thought of the game:

If you decide to purchase this for a more self-confident child or yourself, this is the worst installment of the Animal Crossing franchise. The whole point of Animal Crossing on the Gamecube was for your family to interact together in a virtual town, which can be pretty neat. That dosen't work out on the DS because it is a personal system, the Gamecube was a family system. Nintendo also tried using wireless connections for multiplayer, but that does not work out either. ""Local"" play makes me wonder what Nintendo thought about how many DS systems each family was going to have. Even that is not the social level the Gamecube / Wii provided. Then Wifi, the same thing as local play only over the internet. Friend codes... You work hard to get a friends randomly made number, then you will never know when they are online. Years later you upgrade from a DS lite to a DSi which requires a completly new friend code. Then you upgrade to a 3DS 6 months later... new code, your friends DS lite breaks, new code for him! Of course if you are really desperate you can always share a game card with your family, but then you have to share a house! In the Gamecube version they gave you a little square with 4 houses... one for each player. In the Wii version they spread the 4 houses across the town so you don't have to look at your sister's ugly roof! But on a Nintendo DS, you share a house. My brother and I barley get along in City Folk on the Wii, so we really can't get along in 1 house! Our houses in the Wii look completly different! My brother enjoyed putting fish (because he loves fish) in his house with a nice gentle song playing. My house is filled with 8-bit mario pieces (because I love Mario) and gold sofas with a rock tune playing. It would be kind of hard to combine fish with a bunch of Mario items and have room to spare. If you prefer to play Animal Crossing alone (I don't blame you), you'll have lots of other problems. The animal's AI is really annoying. They walk around, walk some more, and then say the same thing over and over. I was able to talk to Nibbles and then hear Sally say the same thing Nibbles said 5 minutes earlier! It really gets annoying because most of the animals are either jerks or poets. As mentioned earlier, the mean nieghbors were the main reason I stopped letting my brothers play. The rest are pretty much poets. I love poetry, but not in a Nintendo game. One example is that they use big words to describe the weather, when they could say ""I wish it would stop raining"". After having a conversation you heard within the week from somebody else, you would expect your nieghbor to do something else besides use complex metaphors and talk about dieting (FOR CRYING OUTLOUD THIS IS A CHILDREN'S GAME! WHY WOULD A CHILD CARE ABOUT DIET CUSTARD?), but they don't. In the Gamecube version you could do chores for the animals, and they occasionally built igloos and went camping. In this version all that they do on a normal basis is walk around. And forgot NES games, I know that is something that some people bought the game for. No classics in this version though, not even Super Tortimer.

Overall, this game is weak compared to the versions on Gamecube and Wii. The mole is an insulting monster who made my Autisic brother type in negative things about himself. The Gamecube Resetti was much more amusing and less severe. The DS Resetti made me want to smash the game when my brother told me what happened.

As others have said, the main character is completely unlikable. The gameplay is stilted, scripted, difficult. In short, NOT FUN. At the first ""kiss"" scene, I just about gagged. The last thing this character is is charming. I've played the game 3 nights now, for several hours each night. I'm barely at 10% completion because the objectives are so confusing.
Assassin's Creed 1 was hard. I couldn't get the hang of the combat and the jumping puzzles were too twitchy to be fun. As the series progressed, though I really got into it. I finally started to enjoy the parkour races. And the deeper hidden mythology from unlocking intellectual puzzles made the games richer. Particularly the codebreaking pieces in the artwork. I haven't discovered anything of the sort in this game so far and I'm close to just throwing it away. I'll be sure to read the reviews of the next few games closely before assuming they'll maintain the level of quality I'd come to expect from Ezio's adventures.
Update: After throwing another entire night away on this terrible game, I finally realized that I wasn't even playing as the ""main character"" yet. All of that was just setup for the main character, who's still not all that interesting. And the gameplay isn't really doing it for me either. I was completely confused by the resource/cargo tutorial. I just mashed the buttons they told me to mash. As for mashing buttons. I still pretty much die every time I come across a large animal.

The character creation is very cool and had me ready to hop in game and test everything out.  The first thing you'll notice is the character's are difficult to see in game, so my friends really couldn't make out my cool Fallout gear I got from pre-ordering from Best Buy. I normally buy 90% of my games from Amazon, but really wanted the Fallout exclusive stuff. I had to find a very lit up area for them to really be able to see anything cool I added to my character.

Secondly it is a GIANT pain to try and join or get friends to join when you first get the game.  There isn't a lobby system, so one person has to start the campaign and then invite the others and the others don't get to see the first main cut scenes, which takes away from the experience.

Once in game its pretty chaotic.  You can accept different objectives, which is cool, but can be a bit overwhelming at times when there is a lot going on.  The campaign is very short.  My friend and I completed the Resistance part in just a few hours.  The challenges proved to be just as short.  We both completed all the challenges in an hour or so.

So, after completing the challenges quickly and then beating the Resistance side of the campaign quickly we figured the game must really shine in multi player.  WRONG!!! We tried 10+ games and EVERY ONE was so laggy that we backed out.  I never had one multiplayer experience where we finished a round.  I would like to note that we play multi player games almost daily and NEVER have lag issues with any other game.

In Summary:
The game has a cool concept.  The SMART system is neat, but not anything like advertised.  The graphics aren't great, but I'm fine with that as long as gameplay is great, which it isn't! The sounds are just okay.  The guns all seem to be so alike that it doesn't really matter what you choose.  The gameplay is so fast paced that it seems to take away any strategy that could potentially be used.

Seems like they wanted a game with a Team Fortress 2 feel with an xp leveling up system while adding a Parkour element to differentiate it from other games.  It doesn't do any of those well.  It's entertaining for an hour or two and then you'll find yourself asking ""What now?"".  The answer is ""Nothing"".  The game doesn't have a lot to it and the multiplayer is terrible.

Anyway, this product may not be worth the fortune Microsoft demands for it. I bought not one, but TWO of these darn adapters and not one of them worked!

I think we all know what the better deal is.

In Microsoft's defense, the adapter is meant to work and people who bought it and got it to work say it's a great device.

Listen, I love ""extreme sports"" games, and I'm not the most difficult person in the world to please, but Infinite Air should be avoided at all costs. I even recommend bad games at a low cost if they have any redeeming qualities, but Infinite Air doesn't have a single redeeming quality. While I can often find something to enjoy with even the worst of games, this is one that I regret buying. This is the worst game I've bought in many, many years, and considering I paid $40 for it from Best Buy, I definitely feel like using that $40 to wipe my behind would've been a better use of it.

Now why is it so bad? Oy vey, where do I even begin? I mean, literally everything about this game is mediocre-terrible.

1. If you want a game with functioning controls, look elsewhere. While this game tried its damnedest to offer an overly complex and annoyingly difficult control scheme, it failed. The controls fail to work more often than not. Every trick is listed in the menu with its button configuration, but it often fails to register the correct trick, or even register one at all. I've also done tricks a number of times where the trick doesn't even register with its corresponding name on the screen, nor do the points that you should receive for doing said trick get added to your point total. Infinite Air was trying to be Skate for snowboarding games, but it failed at that. Skate's controls work, whereas Infinite Air's controls don't work as intended the majority of the time.

2. The game's framerate chugs along, completely ruining any fluidity the game might otherwise have if the controls weren't so horrendously awful. Whether you're in the helicopter or on your board, this game often feels like it's being played in slow motion.

When you have broken controls and broken framerate, what more could you possibly need to know to know that this game is absolutely NOT worth any amount of money.

Well, if you must know more, here are a couple more reasons you should avoid this game:

3. The presentation is as bland as possible. Cookie cutter, generic, bland, etc. There is nothing inspired about this game.

4. It constantly respawns you in terrible places. Was there a QA team for this game? If there was, were they strung out on illegal substances while testing it?

5. ""But it's a realistic simulation, Horowitz!"" If that was even remotely true, why did I just do a front flip and land it on flat powder? This game isn't even remotely realistic. It wants you to think that it's realistic so that you forgive its horrid controls and generic presentation, because ""hey, a simulation is supposed to be difficult and boring to look at!"" Just, no. Don't make excuses for this shoddy piece of software trying to masquerade as a simulation.

Anyways, I'm rambling at this point. I legitimately hate this game and curse those who made it.

That's when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand-new feature for single-player games: massive, crippling lag. It's a surprising bonus, since you've just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer. Yet somehow, the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there's no one in dungeon but you.

You click, you wait, you die - often with no idea why.

But let's assume for a minute that Blizzard figures out its servers eventually and the lag returns to a semi-acceptable level where the game is playable. Then you find out about the errors. Tons of them. Errors that could have been fixed during this game's literal decade of development. Yes, you read that correctly, it took more than a decade to create this garbage. Yet you'll find constant errors that kick you out of the game, reset your character and shut off your game permanently. Yes, it sounds like it's made-up, but it's not.

For instance, I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 (party error) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn't allow me to return. The confusing part was, I wasn't in a party. I was playing a single-player game.

Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn't run properly, and isn't very fun - even when it's not shutting itself down. The fact is, most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game. But that would have been too obvious.

Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace.

When Diablo 3 does run, it's mildly amusing, sort of like Torchlight except worse. So if you like that, then you'll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with. But I don't have the time to waste waiting for my character to catch up to my mouse pointer so I can die by the hand of invisible monsters.

Therefore, I'll be returning this for Max Payne 3.","Cartoonish, with game-killing lag",1337040000,36,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I'm not a huge fan of FPS games but I love the Star Wars motif and my BF has an addiction to Shooters.  So why did we only play this game for a week?

For me - it has no story.  There is no point to what I'm doing, no end game, no anything other than - be this person, shoot other people, repeat.  Once the Star Wars novelty wore off, I was over it.  Me and the 8 other people who bought this game together - we downloaded Magika 2 for free and played that for more entertainment.

For my Man - he was level capped at the end of day two.  By the end of day three he was bored.  He played for a whole week, knew everywhere on the map to be and had tried every option the game offered.

The DLC started coming out - He played it, I asked ""Does it have a story now?"" He said no, so I didn't bother.  He played the new maps and modes for less than a day and went back to the Division.  More DLC came out, each time it took less of his time, 4 hours on the last one and he was back to playing some Mech game that we got for free.  Finally I saw him uninstall it.

Everything that is out as of right now - STILL doesn't make it a whole game.  The fact that they put out an eighth of a game and called it complete, then made you wait a year to get up to a quarter of a game, is just wrong.  I wish we all hadn't bought it, and this is the first game EVER that I have felt that way about.  Usually I can find something to like about almost any game.

DRM has hurt this game more than any other game before it.  D3 was a blessing compared to SC2013.

Pros:

- The cities are half decent looking graphically

Cons:

- *Small complaint but stupid nonetheless* You are forced to play the tutorial even if you know how to play the game- this doesn't sound like a big issue (and its more of a nuisance) but early on in the game with the server issues it meant I had to play the tutorial 4 times before I could start a city... a tutorial I'd already played 100x during beta weekends... fail

- Cities won't load and there's no apparent fix - this was the simple inability to load my cities... period.  There was no other option, I could abandon them and come back a week later and re-claim and they would still not load.  It was not 1... or 2... or even 3 cities, it was many many cities.

- Game requires too much bandwidth - If you are downloading something or have family members streaming movies and such expect your cities to constantly have issues and need to be rolled back.

- Cities need to be constantly rolled back - even if it's not a bandwidth issue you'll find that EA want's you to constantly roll back your progress.

- No way to save your progress - expect EA to know exactly when to save... even though they wont.  Next time you kick on your game play the guessing game ""how many minutes will I have to replay""

- No way to roll back the game on your own - Can't roll-back your own city progress to undo something you've done by accident or to experiment and see ""what will this do""

- Way too much ""work"" - You'll learn to get sick of the bulldozer RRREAALLLL quick... people abandon buildings too fast and they constantly need to be destroyed. Oh and, patch 2.0 made it to where people will abandon places MORE often.

- The games finances do not seem to scale well - I haven't had to ability to test the numbers (due to cities not loading and a pure dis-interest in the game) but I found it amazing how hard it was to make $$$ with cities that had 350k people when there was very little difference in the cities infrastructure from when it was racking in the dough with 250k or 150k residents.

- Traffic is a joke - It's pretty funny how sims will spend the better part of 12 hours stuck at an intersection.... the game has no resemblance of how anything really works... I don't want to ""avoid 4 way intersections"" or ""make 1 long road that curves so you have no intersections""... are you kidding me?

- Traffic is a joke pt2 - 1 major highway into the city? gggreeaattttt.

- Cities are too small - You can read all about it elsewhere... It's true, there's no denying it.

- No terraforming

- Residents unhappy over stupid stuff - 350k people ""worried about crime""... check crime map... 3 crimes a day... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Oh and, after patch 2.0 people will get upset MORE easily... greattttt.

Ehhh, thats enough for me.  There were a lot of bright points to the game but they get squelched by just about everything.

The only star this game gets goes directly to Amazon.com for allowing refunds to continue even today, weeks after the 30 day deadline... I waited until patch 2.0 to see if my cities would be useable because I simply had zero desire to create new ones. I'd already made 20 cities and there's not enough diversity in this game to justify getting myself back to where I was just to have the maps lost in an infinite limbo again. Yes a few of my maps load, but when big cities are so reliant on the ones around them to provide services and those maps simply won't load, every grouping ended up broken.

1- The BUGS and no, I'm not talking about the accidentally released ""preview build"" that excited fans purchased on steam at midnight(My friend was unlucky enough to get that crap) I'm talking about the horrible hit boxes for the zombies. It's completely random whether or not you have enough reach (or too much, sometimes the zombies will be too close for it to register). I was playing coop with a friend and for some reason, people kept addressing me as ""him"" even if I played a chick. What's the kicker however, is that there isn't even a day one patch to fix (allegedly) 37 major bugs, many of them game ending glitches.

2- The STORY we all remember the stunning first trailer (that put it on the map) of the father trying to save his dying daughter to the sound of a lone violin. Well, this game has none of that. Instead, what we get is 4 playable characters who, although they have a paragraph of info at the start, don't do anything for the plot. Where is the emotional drama you might ask? All the characters do is regurgitate the same one liners like ""Take that, bitch!"" to stupid zingers.

3- The ENVIRONMENT- We were told that this would be open world, and it certainly is. How much of it is interactive? Very little. Outside of the weapons and health items, pretty much the only things that even move are the slow moving beach balls and chairs. Zombies are also not randomly spawned like left for dead, all you need to do is pay attention to exactly where the ""bosses"" come from and then avoid those places since they mostly offer little worthwhile rewards addressed in my next point

4- The WEAPONS- I'm not saying there isn't imagination in the weapon designs, they're quite creative. Unfortunately, most become useless to your almighty foot. Kicking takes no stamina, the knock back of enemies brings them to the floor, and you can upgrade your ""foot"" ability to the point where if you are ever surrounded, all you need to do is put your back to a wall and start kicking.

The point is just like any other FF but i'll let ya know whats wrong with it. First of the main character...Tidus....I think the name speaks for itself. The kid is a moron. Apparently he is a professional ""blitz ball"" player whatever the hell that is. One of the poorest excuses of a sport I have ever seen. More or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics. But in short the entire time I was playing the game I was embarassed just playing as Tidus. Probably the worst FF character their is in the saga of Final Fantasies.

The magic and sphere grid was stupid as hell. You couldn't get your magic without waiting for a couple of years and it took forever to get around it. Remember in the other FFs when you got your magic and spells by gaining expierence or by collecting items. Well in this game Tidus and the gang thought up something new. Now you have to go through this annoying ass sphere grid which takes an hour to learn and another 100 hours to complete(Probably more).

Now the concept is just like I said similar to the other FFs with a story of love involved with the saving of all human kind. Well in this story Tidus is supposed to save the world with his ""girlfriend"" Yuna. The other characters are complete tag-ons and them making an impact on the story did not come into play at all.

Another thing wrong with this game was the boss. Now over the years in a bunch of different games I have seen werid bosses and cool bosses. Nevertheless it was nothing like I saw here. The boss ""Sin"" is a big blob. Not only that but hes brown (kinda makes you think). So with a queerish fellow like Tidus fighitng a Brown Blob Sin the game reached an all time low.

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.

I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.

Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.

For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.

For those of you like me who love Ridge Racer, you'll probably pick this up anyways so get the download version now while the DLC is still free (which stops on April 30th).

This game is a terrible value, even with the DLC. I literally don't understand how they came to this. As you can probably tell by now, the game comes with 3 tracks, 5 cars. If you got the first run physical copies or the digital copy, you get a few free DLCs, which bumps it up by another promised 5 cars and 3 courses. Notice I said promised, at the time of this writing only 3 cars and 2 courses are available. In comparison, Ridge Racer Portable had 12 courses and Ridge Racer 3D had 15 courses.

What immediately comes to mind is ""Well the content must really be fantastic then huh?"" The cars look fantastic, with gorgeous textures and detail that truly show off the Vita's capabilities. However, the courses are another matter. Not only are most (if not all) of these courses ripped straight from Ridge Racer 7, they look terrible. Textures are embarrassingly blurry, environments has low polygon counts, and the reflections have a odd glowly appearance that look completely unrealistic. Make no mistake, the courses are basically PSP graphics with anti-aliasing. If you were hoping for a Ridge Racer that at least had beautiful graphics, this is NOT it. Furthermore, none of the courses are particularly memorable, with one (Sunset Heights) actually being really badly designed. Keep in mind that I played this AFTER the patch, which claimed to have improved graphics.

Fans of Reiko Nagase should know that she does not even get her own FMV in this game like in the previous Ridge Racers, though I guess you do get to see her in the background of the menu, not really doing anything. This was particularly disappointing to me given how amazingly well done the Ridge Racer Portable FMV was.

Some of the few positive aspects of this game involves the robust online play. Online you join one of four racing teams and earn points to contribute to the teams score. The game doesn't do very much to make you feel ultimately attached to your team, but the point chasing is a nice element that gives incentive to online competition.

This is juxtaposed however by the complete lack of a single-player campaign. That's right, with the game only having 3 courses, the wonderfully well-paced racing tours from Ridge Racer Portable are nowhere to be seen, leaving only two single-player modes: Spot Race and Time Attack. These are your typical race against 7 opponents and race against time modes. Fortunately the Vita has trophy support, which can kinda serve as a incentive to gain points. However, for Spot Race, there are no difficulty settings. The racers are stuck to a single difficulty, which means casual racers will be overwhelmed and advanced racers won't feel challenged.

Ridge Racer could have been an amazing showcase for the Vita. Honestly, I would have been happy with just a HD version of Ridge Racers 2 (which sadly never made it to the States). Instead of what we have here is a game that excels at nothing, not the graphics, not the content. Given the horrible critical reception, I really hope Namco Bandai has learned their lesson and work hard to make a much better successor.","Most of you know what's wrong, now let's talk about why it's wrong",1331683200,27,,

Mostly they just lose them, so we decided to buy the first headphones we've bought in a long time.  I showed the kids the headphones before I ordered them, and they were ecstatic!  The headphones cancel out distractions in a busy house/car, and we (the parents) like that they are more hygienic and harder to misplace.

I ordered one each of the Amazon Basic and the Sony MDRZX100, at essentially the same price.  I received both at the same time, and I couldn't believe what I saw.  The Amazon headphones look like the ones you get at the dollar store.  The head pad is just cheap foam, and the ear pads are simply glued in place.  To me, the biggest indicator of the poor quality was the cables.  Amazon cuts off the photo right where the cables get very thin--about 1/4 as thick as Sony.  If the Amazon headphones hadn't literally fallen to pieces within a few days of ordinary use, I was quite certain the tiny cables would have frayed in less than a month.  As it happened, the ear pads were the first to go.  They show absolutely no signs of wear; they just came apart where they were shoddily glued on.

So, help me out here, Amazon.  I love shopping on here!  I especially love the user ratings--when they are based on product use rather than nostalgia.

It seems to me that Sonic Team needed a break from making the worst platforming video games known to humankind, and decided to infect another genre as well: RPG(?) To be honest it's kind of an RPG-lite with platforming. Oh, and horrible gameplay. Lots of that.
Sonic games set the bar for how much suck you can fit into a tangible amount of hard-drive space, and this one does quite well, in that regard.
To be blunt, this game is bad. Now, does it rise to the legacy of Lovecraftian insanity that its siblings do? No, sadly, this does not. How low are you when amongst failures you are a failure.
To the (dis)credit of this team, they tried something new with a character who is known only for going fast and irritating people. They gave him a sword, some armor, and made him kinda slow. Very weird. Not sure how that board meeting went.
""We need a new Sonic game, and we need it fast!"" A single intern raises his hand, ""How about making a game where Sonic actually goes fast but without punishing the player with horrible gameplay?"" The Manager presses a large button on the table and the intern explodes. Some loser in the back raises *his* hand, ""Why don't we stop doing all that, 'Sonic is fast stuff', and put him in the genre where you gotta be slow and methodical-like?"" Everyone cheers, and the random jerk is appointed head of the design team, despite being the janitor.
The above is a very possible contingency in light of this game's design. In the space between repetitive battles and uninspired missions, we find companions that fall short of standard RPG fare. No Lydia-the-Shieldmaiden or Piper-the-spunky-reporter here. I am not even sure you can find what may be deemed companions. Suck-buddies, maybe. Companions...never.

the gameplay wasn't as bad as it could have been, but nowhere near as good as it could have been either. some enemies have an attack pattern that is just fast enough that by the time you get knocked down and start to get back up again, they have already started a new attack and knock you down again, so you cant do anything about it. the ""cinematic"" finishes make you look at the bottom of the screen for button cues, so you can either watch  the part of the cinematic that corresponds to the first button, and then the failure caused by the fact that you missed the next few buttons, or get all of the buttons correct and see the cinematic out of your peripheral vision. bosses were all easy. all you do is figure out its weakness and get it to low enough health to do the final button cue combination, which keeps popping up until you do it right. the one hard part of the game (i played through on the next higher difficulty to normal) is force-crashing the star destroyer (that was a spoiler, so watch out) because just when you get it angled the right way, tie fighters get close enough that you have to stop and kill them before re-positioning it and try to bring it down again.

I loved Mirror's Edge, and the thought of a customizable class-based team shooter with Mirror's Edge-like movement sounded amazing. But I'm not unrealistic - I'm a game developer, and I know how hard a trick that is to pull off. Brink not only fails on the high concept, though - it fails at just about everything else.

The entire structure of the single player campaign is basically a giant botmatch, with some of the stupidest AI ever seen in a commercially-released game. Entire missions can be spent shooting down a single hallway, mowing down enemies for 20 straight minutes until the time finally runs out. The weapon customization is extensive, yet totally pointless. The character customization is gorgeous (the one thing they really did do right), but the underlying class-based nature of the game means that the customizable characters actually work against clarity of gameplay.

More, the class-based nature of the game is horrendously structured - honestly, one of the worst designs I've seen in any game, ever. You can improve your class, but in most games, you'll need to switch constantly from one class to another. So if you want to specialize as an Engineer... FORGET IT. Your team will be completely screwed when a non-Engineer-related challenge comes up.

Worst of all, the much-vaunted parkour system is almost utterly pointless. The level design is such that half the time you can't tell whether you can make a jump, there's not enough visual feedback to determine what you'll actually do as you run forward, and you'll often get ""stuck"" on obstacles you wanted to just run by.

Brink is full of bad design decisions, awful AI, boring weapons, lousy controls, and mindnumbingly poor gameplay. It's a joyless, fun-free mess, and a complete waste of time.

It's not a ""special"" game, but it's quite a bit of fun to play.  The storyline, such as it is, is that you're the ""avatar"" of an Olympian ""god,"" channeling that god's powers to battle against a variety of enemies who are trying to defeat that god.  You become the ""avatar"" during the opening of the game, and while you're in control, you get special powers and abilities which come directly from Mt. Olympus.

The enemies and scenarios are appropriate for that period of time.  Unlike ""Serious Sam,"" the game's lead character is reasonably serious, but the enemies do tend to be more than slightly humorous in how they operate (the roman soldier skeletons move in an amusing ""high-step"" for example).

Or the program ""process explorer"" which allows you to see what's running on your machine at any time (and acquired by Microsoft and provided for free download on their tech website).  Or...  well, the list just goes on and on and on.

I have multiple machines, and I've only ever owned one machine on which this program would even run.  None of my contemporary ones will run the program.

It's a shame, because the program itself is a lot of fun.  The DEVELOPERS did a fine job.  But they made the mistake of going through the publishing house ""Ubisoft,"" a French company which is widely reknowned for using the most draconian and intrusive ""copy protection"" schemes out there.

You'll notice I put ""copy protection"" in quotes.  This is because these schemes have never... not ONCE... actually prevented a ""pirate"" from stealing the application or installing it for free.  However, they HAVE repeatedly prevented legitimate, paying customers from being able to use software paid for...  WHICH IS CRIMINAL ON THE PART OF UBISOFT, since they have never once offered to refund the purchase price of any item which was disabled by their so-called ""copy protection.""

I'd sure like to be able to run this.  The reason I'm writing this review is that I recently did a minor upgrade to my machine, and did a clean OS reinstall as a result.  I'm running XP Pro SP3 (32-bit).  The only way I can get this program to run is to remove my twin BD-burners and replace them with ancient non-writable CD-drives, as well as to remove many, many applications (Nero, for example) which I regularly use.

This is not unique for Ubisoft.  They used an even worse ""copy protection"" scheme for the later ""Assassin's Creed"" games which prevented legitimate purchasers from using their legally-bought-and-paid-for software, and Ubisoft has steadfastly refused to make good on their LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE WORKING PRODUCT OR TO IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE A REFUND IN FULL.

Ubisoft is, simply stated, CRIMINAL.  They are scum, they are filth, they don't deserve to remain in business, and frankly, their senior leadership ought to be prosecuted.  And I'm not saying that out of emotion... it's actually a reasoned, calmly stated opinion.

In the case of ""Will Rock,"" they disabled a perfectly good, low-end but ""fun"" game.  The game is good... and worth playing.  But I STRONGLY recommend you avoid buying it, for the reasons stated above... and I strongly recommend you avoid buying ANYTHING from Ubisoft for that same reason.

In general...  ""Ubisoft"" means ""will prove to be a hassle to run and will, sooner or later, become impossible to run, even if you manage to get it working at first.""

Every item I currently have which has a ""Ubisoft"" label on the software, today, I have to run using a ""cracked"" version.  I'm no pirate.  But I've had no choice, because EVERY Ubisoft item I own causes such severe problems that the only way to reliably run them is to strip out the publishers ""added on"" so-called ""copy protection"" and run the game as the original developer provided it to them.

Remember...  the developers write the software.  The publishers package it and distribute it.  Ubisoft is not a developer, they are a publisher.  They took ""Will Rock"" (a program and associated media content), encrypted the EXE with a copy-protection system (not provided by the developers), put it onto a disk, put that into a box, and shipped it to stores.

Thus, Ubisoft has hurt BOTH the end-users (ie, you and me) and the people who did the actual work (the developers).

I would recommend this game if it could be run.  But the odds of you getting it to run are slim to none if you have a modern machine, unless you're willing to do a LOT of work to strip out every fragment of ""copy protection"" in the game (and there are several tiers of that, mind you!)

In short... if you buy this, think of it like a ""quick-play lottery ticket.""  The odds are, you won't get a prize, but if you're fortunate, you may win something fairly inconsequential but still enjoyable enough.","A fun, ""average"" shooter...  except that it seldom works.",1339113600,,,

Etekcity Scroll X1 (M555) 2400 DPI Wired USB, for a similar price.  Its surprising how the heft of the item impact perceived quality.  The Etekcity is heavier but feels more robust.  Back to the Patuoxun now, I like the quick double-click button.  The DPI button is somewhat difficult to reach and is only one direction.  So you are required to cycle through all DPI to get the one you want, rather than an up-down cycle.

My biggest complaint - after using this for about a day my hand was cramping.  I noticed I have to spend considerably more effort ""picking"" the items I want with the mouse.  I think the resolution is messed up.  I still need to spend some time with it and see if I can get the proper settings in Windows 7 and the proper DPI to use it.

If I find a magic combination then I'll update this review.  At present, this will be relegated to my shelf and used on an as-needed basis in lieu of my daily use mouse.

EDIT - I've opened the mouse and glued in some weights to increase the mass of the mouse (see the attached pictures).  It helps it ""feel"" more robust.  I still get an uncomfortable hand when using for much time at length.  I have been unable to find the perfect settings, but have dialed it in to where the mouse is usable.  I'd still recommend the Etekcity previously mentioned; it has drivers that enable button programming/macros too, for only a few dollars more.

EDIT 2 - Over 3 months of use and my hand still cramps.  I am moving this device to the junk drawer.  I am lowering from 3 stars to 1 simply because this mouse is an ergo nightmare.

I pre-ordered the original ""base"" game because of how much I loved Halo.  I was mildly disappointed with the poor content, horrible story, and extremely buggy PvP and PvE.  Yet, I persevered as I believed Bungie when they said they would improve the game and add more content.  It turns out that the additional content meant spending money on expansion packs.  When the Dark Below was released, I was no longer able to do as much as I did before it was released.  I couldn't do the dailies and weeklies anymore.  I was locked out of some of them because they were ""expansion only.""  So after a $60 initial layout for the game, I paid another $35 for the next 2 expansion packs.  The Dark Below expansion pack added a good raid but it wasn't as good as the Vault of Glass.  Also, it didn't add another planet, just rehashed destinations on the planets already in the base game.  The added story was also very measly.  Then House of Wolves was released but there was no raid.  The story was a little better and the Prison of Elders was initially fun but it too disappointed for the money.  After $95, I still felt that I wasn't getting my money's worth.  The only fun in the game was doing the raid with my friends.  But doing 2 raids is not worth $95.  I put in a lot of hours waiting for Bungie to fix server issues, network issues, horrible glitches, imbalanced weapons, and other faulty programming as they promised to fix it.  They did but it came in the form of the Taken King expansion pack.  Without this expansion pack, the game is pretty much useless.  In other words, the people that were loyal to Bungie and gave them $95 have been burned for being loyal because the game is now unplayable for them unless they lay out another $40.  So after $95, I could no longer do the dailies, weeklies, or even earn legendary marks so I can get new equipment.  Why are they taking things away that you've already paid for?

I'm not asking that Bungie give expansion packs for free.  They deserve to get additional pay for their additional work.  I'm just saying that they shouldn't take away content I already paid for.  Expansion packs should be additions; not add something but take something else way.  They should also focus on fixing bugs before working on new content.  The game was fun at first, but they ruin it each time they release an ""expansion"" pack.  For those that just got into Destiny and have the Taken King, you'll have fun initially...until the next release and then you'll get angry at what Bungie will take away from you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  At least, it's a beautiful looking game.  The music is good too.

As for the contents in the box, the disc is only the base game.  All DLC's are in codes that must be downloaded.  And with Bungie's servers, this can take quite a long time so be prepared for 20 - 40 hrs of downloading before you can play.  Bungie should've included all 3 DLC's on a second disc.  So if you don't like it, you can't get much of your money back cause you can only sell the base game, which is worthless without the expansion packs.  The Taken King story may be good.  But, getting to light level 320 can only be achieved by grinding with raids and even then it's not guaranteed.  And they made the light level worse cause it's now based on all of your gear.  Why should your primary weapon's damage be reduced because your heavy weapon's light level is low?  Now you have rare(blue) gear that's more powerful than legendaries(purple) and even exotics(yellow).

I'll update this review again if I manage to get the next one to maybe work.

***
Setup looked so simple (especially with how scant the instructional pamphlet was), you take your platform of choice's controller, plug the included USB Micro end into that, plug the USB-A end into the Mayflash stick, then take the attached Mayflash's USB cable and plug it into that console. I tried two Xbox One systems (an X, and a Battlefield 1 ""storm grey"" S models) and three official MS wireless Xbox controllers (all of the current 3.5mm headjack line--no crusty, first revisions), and I got absolutely nowhere. I'm wondering if it's actually an issue with something being soldered wrong, or if the stick's USB port just happened to be faulty, nothing I would try worked. The closest I got was seeing the lights next to the turbo functions finally light-up when I plugged it into the PC to try to update it.

Initially, it took me a little bit to realize that the gamepad picture on the top-left Input toggle of the fightstick was actually a third function and not just an icon for what the toggle does; this is one of the only steps included in the instructions for setting up your controller, by the way. There's an all-encompassing, IKEA style diagram that shows a simultaneous depiction of every combination of ""controller + fightstick + console"" that can be used together, and under that is a brief 2-3 individual lines of instruction for plugging said controller into the Mayflash.

I see word here on Amazon that when you have problems syncing your Playstation controller you need to hold Start + Y, which is maybe the most curious to me, since this isn't seen anywhere in the manual, and the website is so scant it is basically just short summaries of all available Mayflash items, along with some firmware downloads (only the most recent version is available for each of their products, from what I saw) along with actual-text hyperlinks to customers' YouTube videos... that's when I really kind of lost hope in finding anything useful coming directly from Mayflash. (The product page is here if you'd like to take a gander at the instruction, that is if the domain decides to load at all: http://www.mayflash.com/Products/XBOXXBOX360/F500.html ) Oddly, I couldn't find much in the way of help ANYWHERE on the internet when searching for steps to remedy connecting to an Xbox One.

I made it as far a one challenge where I failed and faild and failed and I'm a major experienced gamer from way back who likes hard mode.

Nope, his was too. I initially thought this used a USB connection to directly connect to the Wii U. It does not. Instead, it goes into your Wiimote and your Wii U sees it as a Classic Pro controller. There's problems with this that simply make this a bad choice:

1) Input lag is clearly there. It takes about 15%-25% of the controller's speed out of the equation, especially when your character first moves from respawning or from the match starting. This alone should make you close this tab and never look back.

2) It sees it as a Classic Pro Controller, so your C-stick will often think you're hitting the jab button. Perfect pivots and even following up with standard combos after a jab is so ridiculous. You may as well call the C-stick the Jab-stick. This is severely frustrating if you play competitively or online.

3) Uses Wiimote, so it uses batteries. This is a smaller issue that's not really a problem. But why use something that's inefficient, frustrating, AND wastes battery when you can just use a no batteries required direct connection instead?

Save your money and wait for Nintendo to release more official adapters for 20 dollars OR buy the Maytag version. Yes, this small adapter is also Maytag but the bigger Maytag hub is an actual direct connect AND it works with PCs.

The feel of the character during movement and shooting is inexcusably remedial, very slow, very tedious to aim, and like others said it takes far to much effort to drop 1 guy.

The game reminds me of a poor man's Red Faction 2 for XBOX with noticeably better graphics, but as far as 360 goes, the other 6 games I currently own surpass PDZ in the graphics department.

So the reason for my title is that for those who game this game 5 stars...where exactly are you standards?  I can think of at least a dozen shooters off the top of my head for the regular XBOX that I'd rather be playing than PDZ, and Doom 3 in my opinion has better grahpics than this game.  Halo, Halo 2, Doom 3, Project Snowblind, Mace Griffin...the list goes on and on, and obviously Quake 4 and COD 2 for the 360 trump this game.

Do yourself a favor, even if you love spy-type storylines and you're in need of a shooter, rent it first and you'll see what I mean.  It's maybe worth 10 bucks when the price comes down, but definitely not worth 40-50, and most definitely not a launch console seller.

I'm a big fan of ECDub. I even flew out to Philly once for it. But when I bought ECW Hardcore Revolution, I got totally ripped off. All it is was WWF Attitude with different wrestlers and a Barbed Wire match.
Nothing was really changed about it either. Same gameplay, same graphics, same everything, and total dissatisfaction. Granted yes when Acclaim lost the title to release WWF games and nearly killed the WWF franchise with it's awful new games (not including any of the older Acclaim WWF releases on SNES), why didn't they learn anything from that and not do that to EC F'n W???
Like I said it was the same game as WWF Attitude, which wasn't all that good either but it was entertaining for a while. Now granted yes that in theory, this should have been fun too but by the time this was released, we'd seen all of that and then some in WWF Attitude and there was truly no need for this game unless you loved the ECW brand.
Don't get this one. Even if it was the last thing that had anything to do with ECW you could still do without this game. If you really had your heart set on collecting anything from ECW, I would suggest getting some old ECW DVD's and VHS (if you still have VHS).

Unbelievable.  You wonder how that could happen.  You gotta verify two things: that it sounds ok through the earphones, and sounds ok from the mic, and there's no variation at all in the systems that it is being used with, so it's the simplest thing to test imaginable.

Like others have said, very comfortable headphones, nice sound, but useless mic.  And personally I'm not swallowing the ""the good news is it's not the mic"" nonsense.  All it takes is one look at the mic to know that it's poorly designed.  The mic doesn't point at your mouth!  So it's recording from your ear! So it would have to have a omni-directional pickup pattern, which means that even if the mic were decent, and boosted enough to hear, you'd still be getting a ton of ambient noise.  It would probably pick up noise from behind you better than your actual voice ironically, that's of course if it actually worked at all.  Ugh, what a disappointment.  Nice job Polk.  Your ""collaboration"" yielded an expensive POS that is worse than the $.99 headphones that come with the xbox one.

Edit 3/19/14 - Interesting that Polk still is steadfastly clinging to the ""there is nothing wrong with the mic"" bs, but at the same time they are now promising to offer a free replacement ""boom"" mic (that will now be close to and point at your mouth, like every other respectable gaming headset).

The buttons are amazing, especially a b x and y- they're light as a feather, and feel more like a very high-end mouse click than a controller button.

The longer triggers and adjustable thumbsticks are GREAT for racing games, though I admit for fps games I just leave the triggers on the loosest setting.

The d pad is great for blops but worthless for just about anything else.

Now on to the part where it gets one star:

It lasted about 4 weeks before it started to fail.  The left thumbstick started ghosting (basically it registers upward movement when it's not being manipulated at all), the housing started to crack and creak jut from squeezing it to press in r3, and finally, the left trigger stopped sensing consistent presses before I threw in the towel.

I'm sending it back to razer, though I'm not really excited about my replacement. It's too bad too because ergonomically I'm not sure  much could be improved- its an awesome controller!. Sigh.

EDIT / UPDATE: Razer replaced the defective unit.  In fact, they screwed up and sent me TWO replacements.  WOO-HOO!  Right?  RIGHT???  Nope.  Wrong.  Both replacement units (brand-new in the box replacements, not refurbished units) broke within just a couple weeks of use.  Since they sent me multiple replacements (I had argued my way up to a supervisor after having my return order ignored for over SIX MONTHS, and both the supervisor and the person I originally dealt with accidentally sent me a replacement), I figured I would use them one at a time.  Basically, I thought: ""if the next one breaks, I'll still have a third, brand-new in the box, waiting as a replacement.""  Three units in, I figured I'd HAVE to get my money's worth.  Nope.  The first replacement lasted less than 2 weeks, which is less than ~10 hours of gameplay for me, before the left trigger started registering button presses like a strobe light (quite the trippy effect when trying to aim down the sights in an FPS game).  The second replacement admittedly lasted about 6 weeks, and then the thumbstick ghosting started up and the B button stopped working.

Needless to say I sent it back the same day.  And to think that I was considering buying it at one time!  Ech!

Okay, let's crack my knuckles and prepare to rant!  (Ha ha)

The biggest problem is how often you'll die in this game, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah, I think you get it.  As you're being chased by cops (who for some reason seem to commit the city's entire police force just to stop you), you need to be on the lookout for your escape route, that next jump, that next ladder, that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the level's goal.  The problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden, so it's all too easy to pass them right by and run face-first into a dead end.  So by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back, you're cut off by the fuzz.  Oh, and did I mention the cops shoot?  Yes, they open fire on an unarmed, non-violent suspect.  And you drop dead after just a handful of hits.  Stopping to survey your surroundings isn't an option either, because the fast-moving cops are right on your arse; you need to be constantly moving if you don't want precious Faith painted red with her own blood.  Trying to fight the cops isn't the answer either since Faith is a lithe, agile athlete built for speed rather than combat; trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal, and will again get her painted red with her own blood.

So it's a cheap trial-and-error system that's in place: you'll get painted red repeatedly, replaying the same segments over and over again, trying to find the obscure key passage.  The hints that Merc, your boss, feeds you over your radio is completely useless, since he says redundant crap like ""Cops are coming!  Get out of that building now!"" or ""Get off that roof, Faith!  I don't care how; just do it!""  No, really?  Cops are coming?  Wow, Merc, you figure that out all by yourself?  Speaking of hints, holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction, nowhere near where you're actually supposed to go.

Wait... I'm not done!

The control scheme also suffers from bad design.  The ""Up Action"" function (which is the game's fancy-pants way of saying ""jump button"") is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function.  This function is mapped to the left bumper, one of the less reliable buttons on the 360 controller.  Your only alternative is the RIGHT bumper, the OTHER unreliable button.  Genius!

I give the developer, Dice, kudos for trying something new.  I really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new: the free-running premise, the MTV-style cartoon cutscenes, and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh.  The city, in particular, is rendered in blinding, stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized.  This color palette does a good job of reinforcing the game's storyline wherein an all-powerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance, but at the cost of all freedoms.  The concepts that Dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry, but it's truly a shame the game's mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my head.

1.0,True,"01 8, 2013",A3OI05RGQQN33R,B004EW948E,Rock Hard,"This was an amazing game from start to finish. The story, the casting (except for one), the boss fights, and the graphics were tremendous. But the creators of this game loss many stars for erasing all the credits one earns during the game and all you did, earned, accomplished is forgotten; meaning I could not upgrade the weapons for the other allies during another play through.  And if I ever decided to play it on a harder level my weapons would be just as wimpy as my very first game instead of all the upgrades I went through to strengthen and create a more powerful weapon which would have made playing at a harder level a tad easier.  If not for that screw-up and a few others, I would have gladly given it 5 stars.  Because the game strips away everything, it creates a barrier against playing it again.

All the characters were great but one and it happened to be the main character.  For starters, he's cross-eyed with a small head, arms as thick as his legs and his face reminds me more of a reptile than a male protagonist.  They tried to copy the Nathan Drake character from the hugely popular Uncharted series and failed. Instead you end up with a freakish appearing persona which I did not like in the least.  I would have greatly preferred his friend Bo or Charlie to have been the protagonist of the story.  They looked more like men than a badly put together human being.  I wish he would have been the one who turned out to be a robot so that the rest of the crew could have laid him to rest...permanently.  He appeared to be an inbred or a genetically fouled experiment.  Even the robot Cain had more personality than this guy.

Say you played the entire campaign once...maybe twice.  And one day you pick the game up and instead of going through the entire campaign again, you decide to just play certain chapters to concentate on certain characters in order to unlock the trust trophy associated with one of your allies. Say, you play for an hour or two and you quit, it saves and you think nothing of it.  Well, here's the bad news, I did just that and the next day when I pressed ""continue,"" instead of taking me back where I left off a day prior, it took me back to the last save of the full campaign--which was the last boss fight.  What miscreant thought up this post game menu of miserable choices that do not save data?  This game is not as great as I thought it was.  How can you select a chapter and it won't be saved--what's the point in playing it if you can't come back and pick up where you left off.

This game is definitely a one time play and it's not worth picking up until it's $10 or less new or used. For that I'm taking another 2 stars and it's got only one now.

I enjoyed Evolution's Motorstorm and Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, so I wanted to check this game out despite the pretty poor reviews. While the graphics are stunning, and the lighting is some of the best I've seen in a game, the driving doesn't feel satisfying at all.

First and foremost, this isn't a sim racer, so I won't judge it as such, but it also doesn't feel enjoyable like arcade racers. It's a mix of a little bit of sim and a little bit of arcade without dedicating itself to either style and it ends up feeling flat and unsatisfying because of that.

Secondly, this game has so many issues with its netcode. I'm shocked that this game still hasn't been fixed yet. I was going to wait longer to buy it in hopes that it would be fixed, but I saw it at Family Video to rent and decided that I'd give it a go, and it's still not fixed.

Lastly, the A.I. is laughably bad and unacceptable for a 2014 racing game. The cars have a path like old racing games, so it never feels like you're racing an intelligent opponent.

The game we are presented with, after almost 5 years since announcement, is entirely too short and the different difficulties/characters add minimal replayability to the game.

I completed normal and nightmare difficulties and was just too bored to continue playing into hell difficulty. The core of the game is the item drops which are dumbed down from what we had to choose between in Diablo 2. You're going to only be looking for your primary attribute, vitality (health), and attack speed. Gone are the neat effect granting items from Diablo 2 (on being hit cast such-and-such spell, and too many others to list). The item drops are also painfully rare, with emphasis on visiting the community trash bin (auction hall) for decent items.

The real killer of the title for me was the uninspired story. The whole plot reeked of being made up as they were going along. I will say that act 1 was pretty interesting until the butterfly gal started destroying aspects of the lore. The other acts felt rushed with the random events disappearing almost entirely for Acts 3 and 4. There is no strong villain here, I never felt like my actions were urgent.

One of the biggest questions I had going into this title is what would happen to the heroes from Diablo 2? After Diablo 1 we learned the fate of all 3 of the heroes (rogue became Blood raven, Warrior was Diablo, ect). All we get in Diablo 3 is a very brief mention of the necromancer in one of the all too rare events. The awesome idea of making the playable barbarian the same character from Diablo 2 was completely scrapped, which would have provided an interesting spin on his perspective of the story.

If you're looking for a fun title to play for one week, pick up Diablo 3. Don't expect the epic story and replayability of the predecessors. I sure miss Blizzard North..",Complete Disappointment for a Longtime Fan,1340582400,10,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

But don't think that even with all graphical options enabled you're home free, the game has really below average graphics, i mean it's not mediocre by any means, but really not much to look at.

The character sometimes looses the ability to move for some reason, while you're getting grilled by random guys, you gotta restart from the most recent checkpoint, which brings me to yet another problem, the save system, i went through 3 different mission pieces and for some reason when you save and come back,it brings you back to the start of very first one, which doesn't help at all seeing as the reason one had to reload the savegame in the first place was because the other common habit the game has, is throwing black screens at you in the middle of story videos, leaving you no choice but to go to your windows task manager and close the process out and try again.

1.when you start you do missions and build up points to lvl nothing new here but some of the things you find are super strong for the last expansion so say before the expansion you had a fight with a lvl 85 boss it was kinda hard now with the new foods and gear you might be able to beat him with just half the people it took before ....WHY they want you to be bored and have to buy the expansion.
2. You do the missions and if you even remotely hardcore and spend some time playing it is a week before you blow you way pass all the new stuff and are lvl 90 hence they say this is the real game comming to life and that is DAILES all the time about 3 different sets of dailes so you can get rep with factions to buy better gear so you can go into harder raids to get better gear got it ?

3. The raids you need the gear for are not out they say they will be at a rate of maybe 1 every 2 weeks and then there are not that many .Example i have a gear item lvl of 475 there is a requierment of 470 for my next raid but there is not NEXT raid also my gear is so good when i go to a lower raid or dung it is way to easy.

4. Crafted items you need to make to make you guy even more power ful are on a timer so say you want to put a spell on a sword to make it more powerful well it takes a crafter 20 days to make just one spell so if you duel wield you will need 2 scrolls and that is another payday for the game maker and you better hope you don't find a better swrod because that another 20 days  this pretty much kills the economy of the game and makes skills stupid .

5This is the worst of all if makes you hate to play it takes away the joy of playing because your in a dog eat dog game now no working together because most things can be killed alone so people don't need to group so they just fly over your head and killsteal a npc you were waiting to kill and even say rude things as they do it. The game brings out the bad in people and it shows.

6. I read someplace they sold 2 mil copies of this game and with that many people playing and paying that is close to 400 mil a year to this game maker and for that i would expect more then 2 weeks of content and then nothing but grind for a piece of gear that i cant use because i am already to high of a item lvl as it is to make any fight hard and i have to deal with all the other issues spoken of here already.

7So cash machine people always talk about the FREE market well this is the end game people all the good game makers have been bought out and all we have left is a group of people who know they have you by the shorts and don't care anymore they just want thier next bonus for getting a bunch of people to buy junk i of course don't play anymore and i hope you don't buy it because you just going to waste your time and money on a peice of junk.",this game is bad just a cash machine,1352160000,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

There are a number if issues I have with this game, but lets start with a few I'm having.  This game requires a ALWAYS ON INTERNET CONNECTION!!!  Why for a SimCity game?!?!?!  #1 reason is Digital Rights Management.  It's suppose to be for the Social Aspects of the game, which I really don't give a crap about but that's their excuse.

So first off I Installed the game.  Then it had to get a Update, which so far ok.  I had to create a account.  All fine and good, whatever, then I try to play the game, this is where the Server issues came up.  you CAN'T play at all unless you're connected to a server.  Of course they were all BUSY for the first coupe days.  That's bad enough, and it seems after 4 days or so, it's not such a huge issue for that part.  So after 2 days I can finally connect to a server to even play the game.  Well it seems after I'm on my Map, and start to do anything, after about 5 minutes my screen goes black!  Then My Monitor tells me it's lost it's Video Signal.  That's a first, new one on me!!!  I can't do anything at that point.  I can still here the game audio running, but I can't quit out of it or anything.  I have to do a hard forced shutdown, then Boot the computer back up.  It does this to me every single time I try to play!!!

This is why I would like the rate the game a -1, because I can't even PLAY it!!  At least with a crappy game in the 1-2 star range I would be able to play it. Not SimCity!!!  Even after they get all the issues with the game fixed in the future, however long that takes, if ever, what happens in a few years when they decide to take the servers down?  Well your Copy of the game is now completely worthless!!!  You Maps, everything are all saved in the cloud.  There's no local game play at all.  I was hoping for a great game, what a disappointment!

Storyline:  Where can I begin since there is no coherent story in the game.  You never get a clear picture from star to finish.  Whenever story comes up it ends so fast before you can take in what just happen.  Like the beginning with Starkiller getting a lightsaber from his prison cell?  Why is there a lightsaber in his prison ( he is a force user).  Why did Vader revive or clone Starkiller when he got beat down by starkiller?  He could have taken down Sidious with Starkiller but refuse to do so in TFU1, so why would he bring him back?

Graphics: Very nice.  Only good part of the game.

Gameplay: Pretty decent but gets old fast.  You get your abilities way too fast and you do nothing new down the line.

Length:  Very short game.  This could be a plus since I couldn't wait to finish it.  It was hard to keep playing it.

Characters: Horrible.  Starkiller is the worst character to come into Star Wars since Jar Jar Binks.  He has nothing that he brings to the lore other than nonsense.  Starkiller has no personality, accomplishes absolutely nothing but dying or crying that he isn't with his girlfriend.

Lots of cute new characters for those who liked the women of the RA series.  Supports high resolution gaming :).  Fun to run it at 1920 by 1200 with all effects set to maximum.  Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.

That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:
--------------------------

*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)

*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.

*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of ""hero"" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more ""tough"" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.

*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.  I don't even use her anymore to speak of because of this.

To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.  However, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game on STEAM instead of in boxed retail form, since STEAM will not include any of the activation limits or SecuROM malware/trojans/spyware type of crap that will infest your computer if you install the retail version.  I might have given the game 4 stars or so if not for the negatives I listed.  Due to SecuROM in particular, I'm gonna have to give this a measly one star.  If you're considering getting the game on STEAM though, no worries about the DRM concerns I listed as far as I know, so this review in large part wouldn't apply.",Retail RA3?

Issues with game:

In short: it feels like 8 bit movement but looks like a modern graphical game.
~ Control scheme is proprietary, Instead of using a well known method moving your character around in game.- targeting, fighting, crouching, cover, leaning etc.  of most FPS games like COD, GTAV, HALO, Even DUKE NUKEM did a better controller feel. - and others that have game mechanics that actually work. - It feels very awkward controlling your character. This leads to much over aiming and re-compensation making what should be an excellent FPS game fall short of the name it was bestowed with. Developers goal must have been to make the feel of moving your character around like using WASD without a mouse. I won't be finishing it, I find it overly frustrating though trying to navigate the games mangled controller interface.
Anyone who prefers the responsiveness of the old nickel arcades playing q-bert or tron will love this game. - Anyone who prefers more fluid controller dynamics like COD, GTAV, HALO- even Mario Bros for Nintendo felt better.

1.0,False,"11 18, 2005",A1OZEX6BNJEDBM,B0009PM8V0,Jeff,"It's all too easy to draw parallels between Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The classic mascot characters have endured the years to become videogame icons, recognized and loved by millions of game addicts around the globe. Nintendo's fat, Italian plumber helped pioneer the platformer genre and SEGA's blue hedgehog transformed it completely, placing a new emphasis on speed and rollercoaster-inspired level designs. In the old days, Mario and Sonic stood on even ground, each taking lead roles in an impressive selection of critically acclaimed titles. But as the years passed and consoles become more and more powerful, Mario's inevitable jump to the third dimension faired much better than Sonic's. Case in point: Super Mario 64 is remembered even today as one of the greatest games of all time. Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast is conversely thought of as a flawed, but still enjoyable sequel by hardcore fans, and an altogether broken platformer by everybody else.

It is more than a little puzzling, therefore, that developers SEGA Studios USA and Sonic Team continue to draw upon that archaic, clunky design for various Hedgehog-based sequels. Sonic Adventure 2, for instance, hit Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube with the same fundamental mechanics and shortcomings that blemished the original title. And now, the software house has created Shadow the Hedgehog for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, a game that looks and plays like it was designed for Dreamcast a full six years ago. Sonic's darker half occasionally shines in the same way that its predecessors did -- namely, with an impressive sense of speed and dazzling stages complete with trademark twists and turns. And it's solely for these reasons that anybody who defends the original Sonic Adventure will probably like Shadow's one. Alternatively, though, players unimpressed with Sonic's Dreamcast outings will find more of the same here, and unlike a fine wine, age has not improved the formula.

Identity Crisis

Shadow the Hedgehog seems to be Sonic Team's unofficial attempt at aging up its platformer games and as a result the title regularly deals with slightly darker and more convoluted themes that center on the balance between good and evil. The story is kick-started by a gorgeously rendered full-motion animation cinematic that introduces players to the troubled Hedgehog, who has recently lost his memory and is struggling to come to grips with his place in the world. The tale picks up after the events in Sonic Heroes and consequently Shadow can only vaguely recall in flashbacks that there was a girl named Maria, he may have loved her, and she was murdered.

Shadow isn't allowed much alone time before his thought process is so rudely interrupted by the sounds of war and destruction. An alien threat called Black Arms explodes onto the scene and demolishes everything in its path, including nearby city skyscrapers. This is, again, all illustrated in impressive FMA cut-scenes that seasoned Sonic fans will undoubtedly appreciate. Shadow observes this phenomenon with a level of indifference before he is approached by a demon-like figure known as Black Doom, who leads the extraterrestrial forces. The menacing entity acts as though he knows Shadow and commands the Hedgehog to retrieve the seven powerful Chaos Emeralds located throughout the land. The anti-hero begrudgingly agrees, but only because Black Doom promises to restore his memory immediately after the artifacts are collected.

This oddball setup is supposed to extend into and become an integral part of the gameplay experience. Shadow is out for himself and therefore he can and in fact does switch allegiances depending on the preferences of players. The hedgehog can be made to carry out Black Doom's commands, or he can switch sides and team up with Sonic and friends, or even Dr. Eggman. Changing teams is as simple as tapping the D-Pad during gameplay. One quick tap and Shadow will find himself being guided to various goals, such as destroying G.U.N. troops, for Black Doom. Another tap and Sonic and friends will appear at his side to fight against the Black Arms.

The concept itself is intriguing primarily because it enables gamers to choose different paths for themselves as the hero advances through the adventure. The choices made will have a direct bearing on the stages that follow thanks to a branching storyline that allows for several possible paths and endings. This is a clever way to extend replay value and we're confident that completionists will play through the title several times, switching allegiances, so that they may see everything that there is to see.

However, observing the unique goals per different allegiances is a messy undertaking marred by poor design. The fact of the matter is that any level of serious planned strategizing is wholly unobtainable in the intensely frantic makeup of the game, whose mechanics perpetually dart Shadow forward with both limited visibility and control. In turn, even when gamers are trying to fight alongside Sonic and friends, they will accidentally dispose of hordes of allies and even zoom into and activate switches or complete puzzle components that they should ignore. This truth renders the entire operation of choosing sides more or less useless.

Speed, Loops and Guns, But Very Little Fun

Dreamcast owners will already have an unfortunately accurate idea of how Shadow the Hedgehog plays (and for that matter, looks). To be brief, like Sonic Adventure before it. What this means is that speed and forward momentum are emphasized over control, puzzles, or to be frank, depth. Honestly, that isn't always a bad thing. Shadow, like Sonic before him, has his redeeming gameplay moments. We're referring to the rollercoaster-like stages complete with loop-de-loops, corkscrews and pinball bouncers that send the hedgehog zigzagging up and down environments at remarkable speeds. Because these scenarios are still plentiful, undeterred supporters of Sonic Team's efforts will undoubtedly find something to like about Shadow's quest.

That noted, these thrill-ride fundamentals have outworn their welcome, as far as we're concerned. Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome. Admittedly, Shadow is at its best when the character is zipping through 360s and or skating a rollercoaster track. But it's also during these moments that the game plays itself. It is, in fact, possible, for participants to put their controllers down for seconds at a time and simply watch what unfolds. How is relinquishing control for what amounts to watching Shadow tumble through a scripted corkscrew a rewarding play environment?

Unfortunately for Sonic's darker half, there are all-new problems exclusive to his adventure. The very first level in Shadow the Hedgehog is a shining example of spectacularly lackluster game design and probably one of the worst single stages that we've played in any title for many months. The reluctant hero is thrust into a drab environment and immediately nudged forward -- right into a progression of objects, including obstructing walls and enemies. Disappointingly, the platformer also features a horrendously malfunctioned camera system that catches on environments or even occasionally runs amok for no particular discernible reason. The result? Commonly frustrating undertakings where the goal is to burst forward and gain speed, but before that can happen Shadow crashes into enemies and loses rings, or simply goes careening off a ledge. These impossibly trying outcomes are worsened because Shadow moves loosely through the worlds he explores, which at times makes precision navigation an insurmountable hurdle.

The character can, unlike Sonic, wield a number of imposing weapons, from massive swords to explosive projectiles. But in a move that again harkens back to the days of Dreamcast, there is no lock-on system in place and therefore what is a simple process in other titles is overly complex and cumbersome here. Successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance. Sonic Team has positioned Shadow's gunplay as a primary selling point to the platformer, but in practice the mechanics are really not that enjoyable.

Recycled technology and replicated production values have ensured that Shadow the Hedgehog looks and sounds almost exactly like its Sonic-based predecessors. To Sonic Team's credit, there are more than 20 levels in the game and each is varied in design. Some areas have a futuristic look to them while others feature large metropolis backgrounds and more still take Shadow through lava and forest settings. Meanwhile, the game engine draws long, stretching locales populated with a moderate number of polygonal characters. And on GameCube and Xbox, the fluidity usually aspires for the 60 frames per second mark with some dips. The PlayStation 2 version is noticeably more sluggish despite the fact that it is visually lacking compared to its counterparts. And yet, these are small graphic victories, especially when held to today's more robust standards. Shadow oftentimes looks like it could have been designed for Dreamcast simply because the worlds and characters lack polygon numbers, which leads to a generally square presentation void of curvy shapes. Worse is that many of the game's textures are downright muddy, especially when the camera malfunctions and pans up close, as it consistently does. And overall character animation is primitive and incomplete when compared to the majority of today's games.

Shadow the Hedgehog is proof that Sonic Team needs to get with the program if it plans to compete with legitimate current and next- generation software. This is Sonic Adventure with guns and less polish, and players today are far more discerning than they were six years ago. Diehard Sonic fans will cling to the fact that the title still conjures up corkscrews and loop-de-loops, as well as an impressive sense of speed when Shadow really gets moving, and this is all true. But this doesn't make up for the game's long list of shortcomings, from stupid level design, unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphics.",Does Sonic's darker half have what it takes to dazzle discerning players?,1132272000,10,{'Platform:': ' GameCube'},

Was hopeful for some of this in Brink.

Bethesda has dropped some real stinkers since FO3, FONV included (it was a 7/10 at best) and now Brink.  In short Brink basically uses repetitive, non strategic micro quests that force two sides to cluster in claustrophobic nooks of uninteresting maps.

- The levels are like small sized arenas death match arenas with zero draw distance.
- The missions are really brain dead i.e. go here and have one person press x to start a countdown while everyone defends said position, repeat.  Woohoo
- SMART - instead of a cover system you get a wonky and disorienting jump/climb ability (when it works that is)
- Guns/Graphics/Upgrades - nothing to write home about and don't make the game any more fun
- Incentive to level up = a new outfit.  Gee thanks, I love dress up.

1.0,False,"06 1, 2012",A15LIURAJS5FLP,B00178630A,Ralathar Renares,"I'm starting this out with a bold statement.  I have been watching reviews and videos on this game since release day.  I've checked back every day.  But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched:  I have not played the game.

So WHY do I feel I can review this?  ANSWER:  The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time.  Some of those issue will improve, some will remain.  The game also happens to have issues outside this.  Issues agreed on by both sides.  I'll tackle those too.

Server issues:
1.  Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible, but forgivable.  Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta, and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch.  Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand.  Still, things happen.

2.  Servers being crap on the following week = WTF.  Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta.  If they didn't have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more.  Blizzard has the money, it just didn't want to spend it.

3.  Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this.  Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time/metrics they had for this.

4.  Cannot play single player offline.

5.  Server problems further destroy the single player experience.

6.  Great, now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player.  Bravo Blizzard.

Non-Server Issues:

7.  Character customization has been disintegrated.  While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies, it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people.  Also, that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily.  This lowers replay.  Yes maybe YOU don't have an issue with this but people have spoken.  An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this, minor or major.

8.  Items.  Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play.  Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm.  Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps.  Items also appear to be more rare in general by far.  This lower also replay.

9.  Auction House, for money.  That's ok, that's what the auction house is for right?  Oh, but ya, you're decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now.  At least, once it actually works reliably and they add real money.  So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay.  Because even if you trade 1:1 value on the AH you'll lose 15%+ listing fee to blizzard.  Both sides will :).  Yay?

10.  Randomization is very limited:  While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally.  This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area.  This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

11.  Linear.  With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction.  This inability to freely roam even further limits replay.  Combined with the simplified character customization, itemization, and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out.  People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

12. Graphics:  When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen, I believe them.  This isn't as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it's a big strike.

13.  Story:  I'm sorry again, most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable (if they are kind) and horrible (if they are mean) tells me that the story is simply lack luster.  I don't expect epicness in this day and age, but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no.  Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT.

Overview:

Lets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase.  It's assumed these will, eventually (and apparently with the minimum money investment possible) be fixed.  Regardless it's UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time/metrics/sales predicitions they had at their disposal.

Is this a fun game from everything I know?  Yes.  Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out?  Yes.  Is it a AAA title or worth $60?  HECK NO!!  This is the level of polish, length, and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $15-$20.  This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard.

You'd be way way better off spending your $60 on say, Fallout 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas.  Torchlight + Titan's Quest, and $20 left over for whatever you wish.  ETC.  There are way too many options to justify $60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun.",Unforgivable.,1338508800,13,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

PC GAMER magazine gave this game a rating of 58% out of 100%. That is bad!!!
Let me quote some lines from their review in the January 2004 issue.
"" Frustrating camera controls, not enough diversity in character play styles, disappointing failure, stupidly difficult""
Need anyone say anything more? Don't listen to the reviews that gave this high marks. They are LOTR extremists - the same guys that go to Star Trek conventions all dressed up like Kirk or Picard!!!
First of all, most of the guys that gave this game 5 stars wrote reviews before the game was even released!!!! Second, most of them admit they have not even played the game!!! They just love LOTR. Ok..so do I, but don't go suckering some people into blowing their hard earned dollars...
Are the graphics good in this game...YES. They are truly outstanding and unbelievable!! That is all the nice things I have to say about this game.
The game play is terrible. You have to fight in 360 degrees which means that the enemies are between you and your guy. You cannot even see what your doing!!! Oh by the way, you cannot quick save. You can only save at the end of the level! Generally this is fine by me, but since this game is so hard and camera angles constantly make your life miserable....you absolutely need to be able to Quick Save!!!!
THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING OF ALL - THE CUT-SCENES!!!!!!
ELECTRONIC ARTS force you to watch all the cut-scenes. NO SKIPPING THEM!!!! And some of them are over 5 minutes long!
Here is how the game starts - You have to go through all the production credits from EA Games, among others...get through the horrible THX ear blowing intro and about 3 other stupid intros...then the first cut scene happens - this one alone is about 5 minutes of scenes from the last movie. Then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle. Talk about confusing as all heck!
Guess what...if you screw up the game or just want to start over...you have to sit through the credits and all of the games cut scenes all over again!!!!!! NO CHOICE!!!!!!!!
Thanks a lot EA GAMES!!! You milked the MOH franchise to death and ruined what could have been great and now you are just out to milk money from the LOTR saga.
I played this game through all the way. I normally would want to play a game all over again. Not this time!!!!!!!
Borrow a copy from a friend or at the very least, download them demo and try it out before you buy!!!!!!!!!!
Hey if you don't believe me...read the comments in some of the LOTR game forums out there! MANY, MANY other people that own this game will agree with me 100%!!!
Send EAGAMES  a message, send them some e-mail and tell them to allow skipping past cut scenes, send them a message and skip this game.
Trust me, your money is better spent else where...

But I can't enjoy RUSE, because of it's breakneck pace, and there is no speed adjustment. You can't even browse the map nor give orders when the game is paused. If it were player vs. player, well that's another thing, since both players have the same rules. I have not played multiplayer RUSE. I'm talking about player vs. computer (AI). This would be a great game if it had a speed control, or if a player could give orders when the game was paused. Instead, it seems to be all about how many orders can you give in a minute! You might win if you can do one order per second. Keep in mind, you must also scroll the map and zoom in this time.

They don't even give you time to watch any of a battle until the game is over. I could not even give orders fast enough to deplete my supply (sure I am not one of the fastest players out there). I wasted $75 on this game. I buy games for the occasional gems that I enjoy (such as CoH, and Galactic Civilizations II, and all their sequels), I cannot enjoy RUSE. Unless you are all about speed, I don't recommend this game. Ppls taking speed may love this game, I think that is almost what it takes to play it. I cannot understand why the reviewers gave it such high marks, I have to assume they were getting old and were afraid they were just too slow in their age, and didn't want their editors to know. I went on the Ubisoft RUSE forum, the requests and bug reports thread, and found at least 3 other requests for game speed control. Ubisoft, you need to heed this call.

As for the rest of the gameplay and graphics, it is awesome. I would really love this game if it could be slowed down to a playable rate. I have a great computer with fast graphics (SLI), and I can get unnoticeable framerates at maximum video settings. The whole graphical experience is very good. The audio is well-handled. I did enjoy the replay of my battles, was able to zoom in on battling units and see their great explosions, and watched the armor shells fly in the air. The vehicle units are nicely animated throughout their movements. The air units are also a pleasure to watch, as they dive bomb the tanks. There is always room for improvement though, such as they could have made the ruseopedia accessable without exiting the current game.

By the way, those big long arrows you see in the screenshots, they are just momentary, they happen when you give an order or when you use the ruse to see enemy orders in a sector.

It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's ""Minimum Requirements"" are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing.
After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again.

This means that if the server is down, you can't play.  If you don't have an internet connection, you can't play.  If they ever decide to shut down the servers, you can't play ever again.  You have a $60 piece of software that is useless.

So I have asked people what is the problem with their Xbox, some have told me that I just stop running, others that it burned up after a few hours of game play and my favorite, after having it for 2 months the image is white and black.

Now, onto, Dark Alliance.  I have played the original Baldur's Gate on the p.c. and have played the first video game version of Baldur's Gate on both the Playstation and the X-box.  All of these games I found very enjoyable and would give them between 3-4 stars.
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance deserves one star.  While the graphics are good, they are not as good as the first game and the makers have an annoying habit of making you fight in the dark to (1) make gameplay more difficult (pretty hard to fight when you can't see) and (2) to mask the fact that the graphics are mostly reused from the first game.
Little effort went into originality on this game.  The story is incredibly week.  You play an entirely different character from the first game.  Your character has some secret or mystery that must be completed that differentiates him or her from the other characters.  Once you find out your secret or solve your mystery you will be disappointed because of the anticlimactic reaction of your character and your inability to use the information you gained.

All monsters are incredibly easy to beat (you only need to press one button over and over again to beat 90% of the monsters) with one exception.

i can't even imagine paying a subscription for this garbage I've played smoother HTTP games - where the creators actually seemed to care about what their presenting and their gameplay content.

its pretty clear from the 1st few days you spend playing this garbage if you can stomach it that long, that the designers clearly are just milking a brand name with absolutely zero care factor to actually the game itself, the combat, and even movement of your character in general is SO BAD it reminds me of pre-diablo 2 clumsiness its like the creators have never played a single MMO but just kinda had an ""idea"" what an MMO is and tried to abstractly create it - which i could accept IF they actually stuck with what a Final Fantasy should be, a THRILL RIDE of AWESOME that leaves me wanting to continue to play it each step along the way with over-the-top epicness, like FF7, followed through with attention to detail and stunning cinemas - this game is NONE of that

after a little research you'll find out just how lazy the creators of this game are and who they have overseeing things, for example 3 YEARS ago apparently they messed up the ability to buy single quantity out of stacks placed on the market place - so literally if you want 1 of something you can't buy it, you'd be FORCED to buy the entire 99 stack for an obscene amount which leads to a lot of market-place scamming and just general badness and its remained that way for 3 years - 3 YEARS - and hasn't been corrected so no i doubt any fundamentals in this game are scheduled to improve - ever - they patch stuff - mess stuff up, and thats it - its DEAD JIM. - their so clearly just milking the brand name its disgusting.

for example the cinemas are extremely poorly done, words fail to describe it, maybe a 5 year old could like them, but definitely not 8-10+ their not even voiced, and the text is so corny and BAD its not thrilling or exciting in the least, the best cinema so far is the trailer, go figure. *makes a fishing reel sound*

They ""tried"" to do a Gold Saucer, i guess... the few games they do have are so lame, sadly as previously stated just a huge disappointment  FF7's Gold Saucer for example puts FF14's Saucer to shame.  They even managed to ruin Chocobo Raceing to the point that its a dead aspect in the game.  It defies logic how FINAL FANTASY could be so LAZY and PATHETIC that their predecessor game from 7 ENTIRE generations back, is better designed and more fun then their current Saucer and i think that speaks for itself with how the entire game is created and maintained.

Character Creation, is also a joke in this game - you get like so few choices on what you look like overall you end up looking like everyone else, there is ZERO ability to manually tweak your physical characteristics for example you get a set slide of choice 1-6 and thats it, so expect alot of other people to look EXACTLY or nearly exactly just like you.

I Wish i could of wrote a better review on this game i love most of the Final Fantasy games, sadly this garbage will never come close to being a real Final Fantasy.  its just a badly designed MMO ""wannabe"" with a brand name it'll never deserve.

If you want a REAL MMO i'd suggest Guildwars 2 - smooth/fluid combat, a marketplace thats actually well designed.

I was really looking forward to going home opening up and playing with my friend who has waited in line with me for 2 hours.

For example the smoke grenade now stuns.  Considering every player in the game starts off with one of these it makes it impossible to hold cover.  It has already become quiet common for a gun battle to just turn into an exchange of smoke grenades.  Also they have make it so you can turn frag grenades into a sort of makeshift mine.  Naturally players are just standing on the frag grenades waiting for them to repop so they can put them in your spawn.  They have also added a pointless ability to crawl while you are down.  This is not only pointless its humiliating.  Dont be mistaken, their is not escaping when you are down.  It just makes it funner to humiliate you for the other team.  Another wonderful addition is the shotgun is now even MORE powerful.  Although they have managed to make it possible to keep them at bay from a range.  Close range the shotgun is now extremely powerful and accurate.  It is not at all uncommon to be eliminated by the first shot, which pairs just wonderfully with the smoke grenade stun.  The game has just turned into a race for who can through a smoke grenade faster.  Another huge dissapointment is the game types promised and maps.  The new game types simply don't offer the excitement that simple execution and warzone provided in gears one, and the maps often foster overuse of smoke grenades and frag mines. I can say though the roadie run and cover system has improved vastly.  The campaigne play is much funner, and the story is much more involving.  But as a person who would only by a game for only play I am extremely dissapointed.

I'll keep this review short given that there are 800+ reviews for this game already.

(I have the collector's edition which is why I don't show up as a 'verified purchase')

THE GOOD:
=========

1. Fun to play
It's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.

2. Decent presentation
Graphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.

3. Isometric view
I am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.

THE BAD
=======

1. Server ""issues""
'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.

2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)
Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the ""quasi"" in ""quasi-RPG"".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.

3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)
This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...

4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.

5. Lack of Atmosphere
It really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.

6. Miscellaneous
Bad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.

OVERALL:
========
3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/18/2012)
********************

So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new ""goods"" and ""bads"" for this game...

GOOD
====

1. Better Cutscenes
The ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).

2. Still Fun (for now...)
Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).

BAD
===

1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.

2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)
Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.

3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)
Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.

4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)
More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.

OVERALL
=======
It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.

3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/20/2012)
********************

BOTTOM LINE
===========

So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.

In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...

Final (downgrade) Rating:
2/5 for brief, mindless fun
1/5 for overall quality of the game

*******************
UPDATED (6/1/2012)
*******************

Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.

So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.

Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.

MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3
==============================

1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)
Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.

Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?

Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.

Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!

And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.

So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!

2. ABSURD STORY
By now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...

3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMIT
Eight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.

4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUES
The game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).

5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEO
Yes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.

6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELS
Seriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.

CONCLUSION
==========
Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.

This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.

Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.  I would recommend waiting for the inevitable, and likely imminent, price drop before picking this one up.",Fun but rehash of Diablo 2,1337212800,171,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SiiVH5BaL._SY88.jpg']

Amazon should really consider pulling the screenshots on this product page as they are completely misrepresentative of the product actually being purchased, they are not real, fake, they are photoshopped bulls*** and do not represent the game you will be getting. This entire fiasco has bait and switch written all over it.

I just couldn't stomach it, it is that bad and i consider myself a over the top aliens fanatic, this was a punch in the face and kick to the wallet and a lesson learned to never ever purchase another gearbox title in the future, I won't even get into the looming storyline plot holes and absolutely inept AI, you can actually complete entire rounds without firing one shot.

I suggest anyone who purchased here at amazon immediately request a refund under the guise of ""product not as described"", amazon will give you a refund as long as you don't make a habit of it with digital purchases, they are here to protect us from these types of products when the developer do this. It becomes painfully clear as to why gearbox has such a strict NDA policy on reviews, it's because they did not want everyone to cancel their preorder the second they saw actual game play or honest reviews, because anyone in their right mind would have and nobody knows that better than the developer. If it weren't for the aliens licensing this would be a $15 game if that, no joke.

I don't care how much of an aliens fan you are this game is absolute kick to the genitals and an insult.....this is what the gaming industry has become....they know they created a total turd but they still only wanted to pull the wool over our eyes as long as possible.

I am 35 years old and have been gaming since the commador 64 and intelivision and can honestly say I have never seen such a let down in all my gaming years, i will never purchase another gearbox title for as long as i live.

 Do yourselves a favor and check out some of the reviews before you even dream of purchasing this, amazon will not let us put links in reviews so i would suggest you google search ""angry joe"" for his review or ""videogamer.com"" and most importantly the meteacritic score and review, they all hit the nail right on the head and expand into just how bad of a bait and switch scam this really is.

After the initial part of the review, I will discuss the main reason why I gave this game 1 star which is the Broken Mechanics.  This is also what the pictures and video themselves relate to.  Other big issues with the game are its Online Component and Design.

Graphics:
Okay, okay I'm not a graphics type gamer where its end all be all, but let's get real; the game looks around the same quality as Tekken 5 which was released back on the PS2.  To be honest, King of Fighters 14 does looks better but the fact that this is actually comparable is not...a good sign.  Not a huge deal for me (gameplay is most important for me), but the fact that the PS4's ability is SOOOO underutilized is quite distressing and the fact that it is not at all aesthetically pleasing to look at some of the characters who look bland and washed out.  Some may like the graphics, but this is an eye of the beholder thing I guess.

Music:
Not a fan.  It's some very weird brain scattering j-rock that hurts my ears, especially the main menu theme.  Seriously just listen to it for 4 minutes.  It's an incredible step back from the previous sound tracks.  Especially the Esaka theme which sounded godly awesome in KOF 12 yet sounds way to cheery with way too many light overtones KOF 14.  I advise anyone to listen to the difference of the two.  Anyhow some are nice like the Art of Fighting Theme or Athena's seem to fit and sound nice.  Again, music like anything is up to the eye of the beholder, but in my opinion the music in KOF 14 is nothing special.

Content:
Okay the game is fully fledged and on release woot!  It's got a story mode, trials, time attack, Survival, lots of customization, replay vids, and more!  It's nice to see a game come fully packaged at launch for once!  Unfortunately this is pretty much where the good stuff ends.

Online:
Alright so this is, bad.  The main reason to play any fighting game in my opinion is to test your metal against players around the world.  Unfortunately the netcode in this game is beyond bad.  One out of five or so matches will feel like your players are moving in molasses.  If an opponent rage quits the game can freeze which can hamper your game records such as matches completed.  Other smaller issues would be the game boots you back to the main menu half of the time when searching for opponents.  Not a big deal but after hitting the search button for the 20th time in a row it gets old fast.

Design:
Why couldn't they just have the game keep searching and let me decide when I want to back out?  To top it off one thing a lot of new fighting games (even last gen) now have the option for the player to receive online matches ranked or non ranked while doing other things like practicing on a dummy, playing story mode, etc.  This is bad design and if KOF 14 wants to compete with modern fighters it really should ""modernize itself"" a bit.  To top it off SNK thought it would be a great idea to include a button mash button (SQUARE) or known as the ""Rush Down"" technique that if hit over and over the player can take his/her opponents health down by 1/6 or even 1/5 depending if meter is present.  This is just an absurd addition and design choice so that players that are new can just spam one move over and over.  If you want a fighting game to relate to the general populace more have a better tutorial.  When going online people literally just run at you spamming this crap, and it wouldn't be so bad if the game's own mechanics weren't broken or laggy online.  Worse yet is that the input lag can be up to 6f.  Just unacceptable.  The AI is no prize winner either.  Okay at level 3 the AI is simply bad and just stands there, not kidding.  At level 5 (max) the AI is barely passable and feels like easy mode.  Just wait for it to do an unsafe move then unload rush mode on it.  Even at this stage the AI will occasionally...just stand there.

Broken Mechanics:
Okay, so this is the main reason why the game lost so many stars in my review: the game mechanics are broken.  I know what you're thinking but it is real.  At first when playing online I got the feeling I couldn't block or hit opponents accordingly, and I thought that maybe this game is different.  After all, sometimes attacks that appear to hit high actually hit low and vice versa or even mid range.  I decided to go over one of my previous matches and lo and behold I found out the game doesn't follow its own rules.  what I found was quite disturbing.  In the game itself it says command moves such as Kyo's overhead kick known in the game as ""Ge-shiki Gofu Yo"" should hit mid range and should be ""UNBLOCKABLE WHEN GUARDING LOW"".  Please see the first two pics.  However in a match this did not happen at all and in fact I lost a ranked match due to this and probably a lot more since finally catching on.  After double checking in versus locally I found that indeed Kyo's overhead should break through a low guard as described by the game's tutorial.  If you look at the third picture captured in game with the key data present you can clearly see that my opponent on the left (Terry) was guarding low (notice the blue light indicating a block) and nothing else going on but this should not have happened as the game clearly states itself that Kyo's overhead kick should break through the low guard if nothing else is going on.  In the fourth picture after several key presses I show that my opponent does a correctly timed GC BLOW BACK move on me which is legit and nothing wrong here and is just here to help show what is happening in this small time frame. In the fifth picture I show what is SUPPOSED to happen (notice the white/red flash indicating damage).  I've also included a video of the entire incident that goes slow mo at the point of the problem. This is not just happening with Kyo either as lots of other character's command moves are not hitting appropriately.  So at this point, either the game decides randomly when to apply it's own rules as a result of lag from netcode, lazy developers forgetting to code probably, or it is most likely a combination of all of the above.

Conclusion:
Because the game is unplayable due to the atrocious netcode causing molasses style gameplay, freezing, and other problems in account with the broken mechanics I can't honestly give this game a good review.  Bad Graphics, a lackluster story, and ear splitting music don't help the score either.  With the AI being really bad as discussed along with the broken mechanics and often unplayable netcode all you can really do in this game is trials, but if you can overlook all of that which...is a lot to overlook I guess you'll have a good time.  The sad thing is that I really like this game, when it works.  I've heard there is a netcode patch that is coming but until it comes I would recommend people to think carefully before buying this.

Apparently you can wait in a practice room while waiting for a ranked match and you set the search options to continue to search while in ranked matches.  This all can be accessed via selecting ranked match and hitting R1.  From there you can either endlessly search for matches OR change an option in the menu to wait for a match while training.","Bad Netcode, Bad Design, and Bad Mechanics Oh My!",1472169600,6,"{'Edition:': ' Premium', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SAnGY3AoL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nWSvz70ML._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JuO5i7gWL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812T-KecF6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BQRNFBlpL._SY88.jpg']"

Lo and behold Naughty Dog was not involved in the making of this game. The replacement developers for this game had absolutely no idea what they were doing.

As others have pointed out, the game is ported from the PSP version. This is probably a contributing factor for the graphics not being up to the usual amazing standard of previous J&D games and why it doesn't use the proper right-stick camera control for PS2 players expect. The camera control was a VERY big issue for me. It is broken to the point that the game becomes really frustrating. I was often surrounded by baddies and just had to keep shooting in hopes of hitting the enemies I knew were somewhere out in front of me. The story feels weak and the Dark Daxter sequences feel out of place to me, like they were just tacked on.

I have been using personal computers for over 30 years, and I have never had a keyboard die. Even cheap keyboards that they give away with computers never die.

My use of the keyboard was very ordinary, nothing at all extreme, did not even use it for gaming. Very disappointing for the cost.
INITIAL REVIEW: Cool keyboard.  I think mechanical keyboards are worth the extra cost; love the feel of typing on them.  I also like the LED-lit keyboard (blue on this one).  I also have a Corsair Vengeance (with red LED lighting).  Overall, I prefer the Corsair Vengeance because has  two dedicated buttons at the top to control the LED lighting, and a dedicated volume control at the top, and because the Corsair Vengeance has a metal case (more solid / substantial). This keyboard is heavier than your average keyboard, but not as heavy as one with a metal case. Apart from price, I would pick the Corsair Vengeance over the Rosewill Apollo; but both are great keyboards.  I can not imagine someone being displeased with either one.

(---) It's absolutely bug infested, riddled with quest and progress breaking bugs. I have had to re-log in order to force portions of quests to function approximately 20% of the time. Game breaking bugs made the first dungeon incapable of being finished. I have fallen through the world and been unable to play again until after the servers were taken down for maintenance. Several other times I fell through the world, was forced to re-log, then had to wait 10-15 minutes before I could control my character again. I've lost levels to random ""rollbacks"" - in which the client experiences an error and crashes, and when you log back on you've lost your past hour of progress. I've been killed instantly by terrain, become trapped in rocks or walls or grass, been shot into the sky by passing NPCs......this is disgraceful. I have beta tested many games, played many MMOs at launch, and never, ever, have I seen a game so incredibly unfinished. I am not being hyperbolic at all when I state that this game is still in alpha, and it is a shame that Bethesda is charging money for it

(-) Controller support is absent, and the general keyboard & mouse controls are awkward. It plays very similar to Skyrim but with subtle differences to accommodate for the fact that it's a MMO. Sadly these subtle differences don't translate well.

(+/-) Presentation is generally strong, but suffers from some incredibly low res textures throughout, alongside some awful voice acting and animation. Most of it is good, but the poor parts are truly terrible and jarring

(+) A huge world full of memorable content, on and off the beaten path. It makes Skyrim seem downright tiny in comparison

(+/-) Deep and layered character customization (regarding skills, not aesthetics) that translates pretty well to combat and general gameplay, offset by the awkward controls and some pre-beta level tuning

(-) User interface, crafting, inventory, it's all a mixed bag of poor, dated design elements and mechanisms. It is so awful it deserves its own bullet point. The basic bag and banking systems, common to MMOs and refined over the years, is like something out of a nightmare in 2003

(-) Stability is abysmal. Lag is common. Interactions not working. Group members appearing offline when they're in front of you. Guild functions not working for days. Dropped packets. Etc, etc, etc. It's like some tiny fly-by-night company is running this thing. It's sad

(-) Aggressively drab and uninspired character and gear design. This applies to not just gear, like armor and weapons, but also spells and abilities and class distinctions. I don't expect the players in an Elder Scroll game to resemble blinking neon signs like they do in other games (WoW), but man, even the best gear one could acquire in this game is just plain and boring.

Creatures magically disappear when you fight them, usually just before they die so you get no credit for fighting them. They also teleport in clear view on top of you because the servers are apparently VIC28s.
There were a plethora of exploits known in the beta that they chose to ignore and let the people paying to support the game (which is still much less reliable than eves beta was, or EEs beta for that matter, which actually was buggy) use to advance to endgame levels that now have been made unapproachable for months to most. They embraced the ""exploit early, exploit often"" principle, mostly because a number of them play the game online....and also post on the website trashing anyone who has a problem with anything they do (under their player names, which doesn't denote that they are monetarily connected the game to anyone who hasn't happened to get to know them ingame), and delete totally legitimate posts (I have never had one deleted, but many of the ones that get deleted are just being deleted to promote a fraudulent image of the state of the game, which is terrible).
Worst of all, there are untold numbers of bugs that were known in the beta that made the game completely unplayable, but they chose to ignore so that they could release the game and force the fans of star wars to pay to support it for them (please keep in mind, I play most MMORPGS, this is so far out of the realm of the minute amount other games have done that it makes Shaq-Fu look like viable product).
There was 30 days playing time promised on the box. Out of the 30 days, there was a grand total of 1 that I was able to play without having a fatal error on their end make it unplayable. Having their faulty code damage stats as if armor was on 2 or 3 times over when no armor was on (making some stats negative :P) and insuring anything that touched you would kill you in 1 hit until the next day (or longer sometimes) when they would finally shake it off your character. Crashing for no reason and killing your character in the process, world comes back up an hour (or day, or 2) later and your character has huge wounds that force you to sit around in a hospitol for up to an hour...WHEEEEE. Deleting all your equipment and your money so you run around with starter gear trying to get money is real fun then. Having havesters dissapear with a weeks worth of gathering in them. Having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought. All these things and thousands more were known before release and are acceptable to them (call their reps online and ask about the 30 days the box promises, they openely say could care less about any promises made and they will make no attempt to make ammends for charging you to play while their servers are completely unavailable. They released it anyway to make star wars fans (figuring they are loyal and could thus be exploited) pay for what is supposed to be pre-release troubleshooting and quality control.
It is a shame and I am frankly stunned that Sony would allow this travesty to be enacted under their name :(

(Please save yourselves the frustration, lost time and effort.

Or something resembling the last gen POP sequels? If you're hoping for any of these (like I was), you will be shockingly disappointed by this game. At first you won't want to admit it (because you just dropped sixty bucks on a game with some history in the name) but eventually you'll accept it and will be able to admit that this game will be in the bargain bin in about 2 months.

When POP Sands of Time came out for PS2 I was instantly hooked. I was so enthralled by that game. The maneuvering, the visuals, the imagination, etc. Fast forward several years and then Assassins Creed came out. POP SOT was the first game I thought of. AC was like SOT but oodles better. Then I heard a new POP game was coming out.

I remember being leary about this title because of the cell shading. The ""cell-shaded"" graphics (as they're apparently called) is really just a cheap way to opt out of having to develop lifelike graphics. The character graphics look very last gen. The environment graphics don't look much better. It's like you're playing a comic book.

But, I'm always willing to forgive lackluster visuals if the game has good gameplay. I am not exaggerating when I say that 98% of this game is nothing more than running around and exploring. No fighting, few puzzles, and no risk of dying or restarting at a checkpoint. It is literally impossible to die in this game. The gameplay is basically run, jump, climb, and then repeat. I don't understand what Ubi was thinking with this game. There is almost no point to this game. For every hour of gameplay, you might encounter one or two enemies. That's it. Seriously.

My advice: fight the urge to buy this. Hit a few local rental stores and try it out first. Considering the namesake behind this game, I just can't believe how incredibly pointless this game is.

Rocksmith is a great learning tool and definitely a lot of fun. There is a huge amount of satisfaction in actually learning to play a song instead of devoting hours to pressing plastic buttons on a guitar-shaped controller. It's just too bad the game is so buggy.

The underlying technology is pretty impressive. Things look decent. Things sound great. The note detection works very well most of the time, and the scrolling notation is very easy to read.

For a while, my only real complaint with this game was the UI. It's just a mess to navigate, and it's very easy to accidentally back all the way out of one section of the game into another, triggering a long loading screen. In general, it's just unintuitive, the kind of interface that has you mumbling, ""no, that's not what I meant to do."" But all of that is not enough to greatly diminish the value of the game.

What does greatly diminish the value of this title is that it is INCREDIBLY buggy and unstable. There are moments where the scrolling notes stall or lag for a second or two, times when the game crashes during loading or saving, locking up the entire console. It's just rough. It behaves like an early beta. Keep in mind this is with the most recent patch. Also, keep in mind that issues with the console itself have been ruled out and that similar complaints are found throughout the official Ubisoft forums for Rocksmith.

The real kicker is that the stability gets worse and worse the more DLC you add. If you never buy any songs for this game, you may be fine. If you buy a very large amount, eventually the game can't even get past the initial loading screens anymore. So if you're really into the game, and you buy a lot of songs, the game is essentially guaranteed to completely stop working at some point. From what Ubisoft support tells me there are no plans to correct this with a patch. Their advice is to manually manage the installed DLC, only keeping a few songs installed at a time then deleting them and redownloading another set. They wouldn't even advise me what a ""safe"" amount is. Ridiculous.

This is a product that was just never ready for retail and is basically not being supported by the publisher at all.

Note that these experiences are specific to the PS3. I can't really speak to the stability on other systems.

My recommendation is to wait until Rocksmith 2014 comes out in a few months. The current version of the game basically doesn't work, at least not on the PS3.",PS3 Version Unplayable with DLC,1371772800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So many procedurally generated planets one person could never see them all, with billions of possibilities? Sounds amazing!  But then you actually play the game, and quickly start to regret wasting your money.  Here's how my experience went:

Start out on a random planet, and mine elements to repair your broken ship.  Now mine some elements to repair your equipment so you can scan the area for items.  What's that?  Be able to scan for the specific items you need with a scanner designed to locate elements?  Nonsense.  This game is about EXPLORATION!  You just walk around this planet until you maybe luck into finding what you need.

While you are wandering around aimlessly, fight some flying robots who for no apparent reason are shooting at you for mining resources.  Dead?  No problem!  The location of your last death is on the map - it just takes another 10 minutes to trudge back to the area. Uh-oh, your life support system is dying - you need to go find another random resource. Got that handled?  Now go walk around looking for another random element to fix your engine.  For a game that is so heavily reliant on a crafting mechanism, you would think there would be a way to track the specific thing you need, but thenyou would be thinking of a better game.

This is the entire game.  Repair this, refuel that, die at the hands of robots or the environment, go back to your last place of death to get the items you had, etc.  Did I mention the awesome inventory system? No? That's because it sucks too!  Whenever you do finally manage to fix the ship, then you have to start looking for parts to upgrade the engine so you can leave the current solar system.  And guess what?  NEVER do you get the ability to search for specific things.  Also, there are aliens, but they really don't matter - you can learn some of their language, but all it gets you are more fetch quests.  After you see a couple of systems, you start to realize that for such an allegedly expansive universe, things look awfully alike.  By the time you get to the third or so system,  you'll be hard pressed to give a damn about putting in the time to endlessly grind for the next upgrade.

Also, the ship steers and handles like a broken down car with 4 flats.  Whenever you see a beacon, or your scanner picks up a point of interest,  you pretty much have to fly up and out of the atmosphere, center it in your field of view and fly back down to it to get there - trying to fly towards it on the surface of the planet is yet another exercise in futility as the distance decreases and then suddenly increases!  And guess what?  Occasionally (I'm being sarcastic here - it's pretty much constant) groups of ships that can turn on a f#cking dime with pinpoint accuracy will shoot you out of the sky for no reason!

Here is why:

Controls: When aiming with your gun, you cannot move. You have to lower your weapon in order to move and it takes a second to raise your weapon again. This is a REAL problem when needing to be on the move and fight at the same time. This is not possible in the game. So, forget strafing your enemy as you shoot him (which is a pretty standard feature in all shooters like these.) Also, when switching weapons or using an item in your inventory, I had to open the inventory, navigate to the item and choose ""use"" or ""equip"". When a boss zombie is chasing you, you don't have time to make selections. Come on Capcom, this isn't a turn based game. Then when you do get grenades or mines equipped, you have to go through the same BS to select your pistol again. Additionally, you can only run forward, and not to the side. Good luck dodging that swinging hammer without turning your back.

Gameplay: The game has such tight spaces, that it felt like I was in a maze instead of the place presented. For instance, a village, instead of having all the access to the alleyways, everything is blocked off or gated; so your forced to go in a certain direction. I am used to this in linear games, it just felt like RE5 made very little effort to cover this up. So there was no emmersion for me into this game. When shooting enemies, there were only two effects it had on them: head blows off or they die. So if you shot limbs you see a little splash of blood and the enemy shakes a little. If you hit them enough, they go into their death scene. So weather you throw a granade or slash them with a knife, it has the same effect on their body. The interaction with the environment and stage was the same. You could only shoot piles of fruit or barrels that provided supplies. Except for Tvs, you can shoot those, that's it. So forget body parts flying or debris falling from bullets. It hardly feels like your character is even in the environment, so how am I suppose to feel it? The cut scenes were inconsistant. In one cut scene, your just spectating; then all the sudden in the next cut scene something flashes that's telling me to press X so I don't die. Its senseless and didn't make the game any more fun.

I had no issue with the sound or graphics: neither was great but good.

All in all, this game was way behind in the times. Something I would more expect to have been playable in the 1990s. Now, in the 21st century, as far as gaming has come, absolutely dissapointing.",This game sucks,1342915200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I would recommend this game no higher than a 20$ purchase. The thing is with these type of games you tend to go online for co-op play/trophy requirements because it lightens the load on your end solo play is difficult and extremely challenging. It is very very grind heavy and the mobs you kill are recycled throughout the entire game. One of the most frustrating thing about this genre for me is that they make it as if it's geared toward an mmo play.

I don't even know where to start. The graphics look like a PS2 game, save the usually gratuitously ""depth of field"", also known as extreme blurring of things in the background.
Fortunately it only appears during the cutscenes.

And too in the soul of PS2, it plays (and to me, looks) like some of it's earlier Destiny Warrior games. Only the main enemies are brain-dead zombies who will ignore you almost complete if you duck into a sporting goods alcove.

__This is basically just a hack-n-slash dress-up game.__

It also has some gimmicky, clunky multi-player mini-games, on top of a co-op of the main campaign (which apparently only saves exp and costumes), but they are really really REALLY terrible and hardly worth mentioning. Also and from some repressed part of me, the controls and character movement reminded of Blue Stinger, that dreadful Dreamcast monstrosity.

1.0,False,"12 22, 2015",A1J6WXY7V7JYZL,B00DB9JV5W,Ordinary Guy,"1. False Advertising - The campaign experience is nothing like the ""Hunt for Truth"" marketing campaign. The conflict between Chief and Locke is secondary to the real story, but not in a good way. It is simply rushed over as are most events in the game. The lead antagonist is clearly defined at the end of the first mission...yet they spend the rest of the campaign building it up before they spell it out for you. The entire storyline is very predictable after the second mission because of the giant hints that they give you. There is no plot twist. The entire game is just setting up a sequel. It has a cliffhanger, but not in a Halo 2 kind of way because Halo 2 had a key twist in the middle of that game where this has none. As far as the campaign's gameplay...it starts relatively strong and fresh and gets more stale and repetitive as it goes on. You will play the same (and only) boss at least five times with no variation to the boss's mechanics other than an extra clone of itself.

2. Multiplayer. The game boasts ""dedicated servers"". However, these dedicated servers are not like the one's found in Titanfall. In Titanfall you can choose your server to connect to and it is region based showing your ping as you connect. In a match of Titanfall you can see your connection in a bar represented by 1 to 5 bars of strength. In Halo 5 Guardians, they do not show your ping at any point and you will play people outside your region quite frequently. I find the lag to be much worse in this game than any past Halo game. The servers are just no where near as good as Titanfall and I question if these are the same Azure servers that are found in that game.

This game also has far fewer playlists than past Halo games and is missing core modes that are staples of the Halo franchise such as Oddball and King of the Hill. The map rotation is very poorly implemented and most maps are only made with two or three modes in mind. A lot of the maps even feel similar to each other and 343i simply refers to them as ""remixes"" to avoid any sort of copy-paste backlash. They have a remake of midship/heretic/zealot that is pretty good, but the rest of the maps are pretty bad. The warzone maps are all designed very similar, but Apex 7 is the clear winner here because it's the only one of the three maps that is actually balanced. The spawns in Warzone can be completely horrible...spawning you 30 seconds of sprinting from the base you chose or directly into enemy fire. It will spawn you sandwiched between enemies a lot too. The spawning needs real work here as it seems to be completely void of basic logic.

3. REQ system + DLC. There's a lot to talk about here. Positives and negatives and your opinion on this may be different than mine as it's a very subjective if you feel REQs are worth paying real money for. Some will say there is no pay-to-win. I have to disagree. If you play Warzone a lot and are of high rank it takes very long to rank up for your free pack. Rank up packs quickly become more rare than gold packs. This means you will only be getting a gold pack every 4 matches or so...about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Some players will advocate buying silver packs, but all this means is you will only get two or three mediocre cards every two matches versus eight or so useful cards every four matches. Gold packs are really your only way to obtain the good vehicles or special variant weapons in the game.

To make it worse, what you unlock from a gold pack is completely based on RNG (random number generator - think casino ""slot machine"") and this includes armor. In fact you get nothing for beating the campaign or story mode even on solo legendary difficulty. Therefore players who pay real money are simply skipping 1 hour and 30 minutes of grinding for every $3. Some players pay upwards over $300-500 in Gold packs meaning they are saving themselves 150-250 hours of grinding. Buying REQ packs is just basic math and odds playing. If you pay more you are going to get to the rare stuff faster and have more cards to use in warzone. However, a normal player will easily run dry of cards. I have a 2 k/d and still run out of good cards (sure I have a ton of mongoose and needlers). Of course a lot of players only buy a few packs or maybe $30 worth. It's still a lot of grinding saved, but I question if it's worth it. I just don't like the system because of RNG and because there is an element -albeit much worse in other games- of pay to win.

DLC is funded on these REQ packs according to 343i. So far we have gotten two DLC drops and we will get about six more of them. What we got so far was four forge made maps for Big Team Battle. These maps are remakes, but none of them feel as good or balanced as the originals. The texture quality is very poor and there is no immersion in these maps. The next DLC gave us Forge: a feature that launched with Halo 3 and Reach. Halo 4 also had forge, but due to complaints they had to relaunch it later. Halo 5's forge is not bad, but it's something we expect with a Halo game. All they did was delay a feature that has existed in past Halo games. The new maps with this last DLC includes two more forge maps, one remix called Overgrowth, and a warzone map almost everyone I talk to thinks is broken and hates due to camping, sniping, and getting shot in the back. They just recently added social playlists...a feature that was found on day 1 of Halo 2 and Halo 3. A lot of the new REQs they added into the game are simply reskins of previous armors and vehicles with the exception being the original Halo rocket launcher and variatns. The main thing new REQs did is increase the grind to make more rare items harder to get and give incentive to buy more REQ packs. I personally don't find any redeeming qualities from this system and I want to note that Titanfall had a card system without the way to use real money which made the game more balanced and fair.

Bottom line: Halo 5 is a step down from every Halo game in campaign. The multiplayer is worse than Halos 1, 2, and 3 and better than Halo 4 and Reach. It has a lot of key features missing that put it behind past games and the DLC approach feels like manipulation rather than a good cause. Gameplay is mediocre and pushes towards other FPS rather than setting itself above the competition (something Halo used to always do).

Honestly, I had more fun with games like Titanfall, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and Black Ops 2 than I have with Halo 5: Guardians. Furthermore, none of those three games I mentioned as better than Halo 5: Guardians are anywhere close to the feelings and time I spent into Halo 2 and Halo 3. I miss Halo. I miss the experience it offered that was different and distinguishable against its competition. I did not have the highest expectations for Halo because Halo 4 is my least favorite in the series, but Halo 5: Guardians does little to get Halo back to where it needs to be.

Weeks,"Let me just say first I've been a loyal customer of Bioware since the late 90's with Baldur's Gate and I've preordered and bought the DLC of every one of their games since then and I buy a lot and play a lot of games. With that being said let me give you my general observations of the game and then specific problems that I had. The game starts out pretty good, the graphics seem better and sound and music sound better. The story line starts to progress fairly nice with you returning to the Normandy and then things start to fall apart. The first thing I noticed is your crew is fairly limited and some of those don't show up till nearly the end. I know they said they kept the crew small in order to give more in depth conversation with the crew you have. If that's the case I didn't notice unless they are talking about just standing next to someone while they talk to someone else and eavesdrop in. If you eliminate the go fetch missions where you don't land but just scan a planet there are just a few of those. The worst one has to be the one I would call the TRON mission were you just shoot boxes what a waste of time. With so few missions Bioware had to add some time killing to extend the game by adding a ton of go fetch missions. These consist of where you have to go to some planet and scan for the object and return to the Citadel with it. If that wasn't bad enough you can't go directly to the planet to scan you have the scan the system first and then only 2 or 3 times before the Reapers show up and then you have to do a main mission before you can return. Once you know which planet it's on you can scan forever without fear of the Reapers which makes no sense. Another time kill is some planets are in systems not near the Mass Drive so you have to use fuel to get to them. They limited the  locations were you can get fuel so if you have search a cluster with several start systems not only do you have to avoid the Reapers but you have to leave the cluster to fly to a known fuel source then return. Towards the end of the game it becomes ME 3 the movie with extremely long cut scenes and dream sequences. I found the War Assets a complete waste of time it doesn't do anything other than tell you when you can go to the last mission. Then we come to the end where the things you chose to do have absolutely no bearing on the ending. The entire game took me about 30 hours to complete with zero replay value, what a waste of $100.

Here are the bugs I found:

1. My  Shepard's face did not carryover from ME2
2. Some of the things I did in previous games did carry over such as Anderson should have been on the council and not Udina. I didn't destroy the Collector base but ME 3 says I did. Love interest from Shadow Broker doesn't remember any of that.
3. When talking to people sometimes they disappear when talking to them.
4. When you are supposed to meet with a comrade at some location from an email, they don't always appear at that location.

Then we have the ending which I'm not even going to talk about since it's been beat to death. I'm not sure what happened to Bioware but this just seems to be a repeat of the mistakes from DA2. This will be the last preorder that I'll be getting from Bioware until the gaming community gives it good reviews since it appears I can trust online game reviewers to do their job anymore.",BIOWARE HAS DONE IT TO ME AGAIN,1332201600,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Nomad was the main character of the game and he didn't die.  So what happened?  Why didn't he continue onto Crysis 2?

Why?  Because the writers are a mass of unimaginative gunk....that's why.  There's no logic whatsoever in putting a character into play that wasn't the main character to begin with.  It's like starting a story with Superman and then in the next issue having Supergirl take over and not even mention Superman.  Or like dumping Drake from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and having Sully or one of the girls continue the following stories.  That's how dislocated the Crysis series is.  The creators of Crysis are weak when it comes to continuing something--anything in a logical sequence.  It's beyond them.  They have no talent for it and should do us a favor a get out of storytelling.

Nomad should have been the character brought back to Crysis 2.  But the fools brought back the Prophet character.
No matter, even though it defies logic, he didn't take up much of the story especially since he blew his brains out.  As to Prophet continuing the jagged storyline instead of Nomad, I can safely say it was a great mistake.  And why does Prophet need the Marines to help him find Dr. Gould?  What kind of wimpy super soldier is this bogus creation?  There are not enough fingers to plug-up these bursting dams.

Alcatraz (Crysis 2) is the new protagonist and the story is pretty good and has some sense to it, that is, until you come to the ending and a man that committed suicide once again takes over the body of Alcatraz or so I thought until Crysis 3.  The mere fact that Prophet regains his complete mind, body and soul is impossible.  Crytek believes that you and I are so low in our mindset that it didn't even cross their minds that they were feeding the gaming world left over fragments of bad brainstorming.  And if they did, it clearly reflects their lack of respect for the gaming public's ability to perceive a game full of worms.  For me, Prophet is dead.

These writers are undeniably moronic or smoke a great deal of bad seaweed.  In Crysis 3 Prophet some how not only takes over the mind of Alcatraz's body but gets his body back!  What lowlife thought up this idea...this urine based tale for consumption?  I could not and would not accept this ridiculous impossibility and illogical story.  Alcatraz, to any normal non-seaweed smoking individual, should have continued to lead the way in Crysis 3.  Prophet is dead.

Simply put, it's a stupid and unbelievable story.

Nevertheless, if you ignore Cryteks ignorance in story writing, you can still have fun shooting;  but, fun factor in this game is not even close to Crysis 2....not only in story but in the soundtrack as well.  One thing that Crysis 2 had was an amazing soundtrack which was even better than the story itself.  Crysis 3--forget it--nothing--a flat and uninspiring soundtrack.  In fact I can't even remember a single sound byte from this terrible follow-up tale of miserable woe--woe in maniacal writing.

In the end what has Crytek given us?  They've given us a trilogy of nonsensical and illogical stories that truly cannot be tied together in any believable or enjoyable way.

Also, I expected the bow in Crysis 3 to be something stupendous and it wasn't.  ""Bowhunter Edition,"" is a misnomer.  I forgot about this weapon during game play and only remembered it occasionally and usually, only, after I ran out of ammo for my other weapons--and sometimes I just resorted to the melee function to overcome opponents.  Overall it's one of the weakest weapons in the provided arsenal.  The new upgrade system to the nanosuit is confusing and not easily understood and for most of the game it didn't really seem to make that much of a difference especially when cloaking.  In Crysis 2 when I unlocked all the upgrades for the cloaking ability, I could really tell the difference and it was amazingly useful.  The story is poor in itself and attempts to rationalize the bunk about the Cell taking over when they had been decidedly defeated in Crysis 2 by the military...as I said, nothing adds up after Crysis--the writers/Crytek lost their logic compass and became raving haywires on a mission to create nothing but tangents into every conceivable direction.

In summation, if you wish to play a really good game that suddenly becomes stupid at the very end, then play Crysis 2.  If you wish to play a mediocre game that is stupid in every respect, then you must assuredly play Crysis 3.

First of all, character movement is erractic at best.  My character level is 65.  I have not died at he hands of any enemy YET.  All my deaths are contributed to the erractic movements of my character.  its baffling, im not saying the controls are poor but they are very sensitive.  Case in point, in Demon souls and in Dark Souls 1, when standing still if you tap the STICK up/down/left/right, your character respond accordingly, body turn right, body turn left, back to camera face to camera.  But in DK2, standing still if you tap the STICK in those directions your character will turn so FAST as if they are doing 360 degree turns.  These fast movements will cause you to die on any cliff sides, ledges or even jumping from ledge to ledge.  I adjusted the camera sensitivity but that did not adjust my character movements.

Now another factor thats completely opposite of this fast movement is how SLOW it is to switch say from a STAFF to a SHIELD.  I am a lefty when using magic.  I keep all my staffs and shields in my left hand.  When in combat i notice a slower response on the D-pad.  Switching from staff to shield and vice-versa the animation takes longer.  In Dark Souls you can toggle very fast on the D-pad which can save you from getting stun-locked and killed.  DK2 you can get stun-locked so easy it absurd.  I think they tweaked the wrong aspects of the game.  Overall, DK2 is still playable and i like it, im just not as FASCINATED as i was with Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.

Its still a good game to play and very challenging.  Hopefully, they will patch these animations.

Addition:

I hope they also patch the lack of Human Effigy found or available.  I think Human Effigy should be given after the defeat of each Boss.  They definitely should change getting invaded while hollow.  I been invaded more times as a hollow than in human form, go figure.  I do have the Binding Ring but you still lose HP after each death with the BR on.

Edited 3/20.

I am level 120 now and ventured 75% of the game.  The game is broken.  Let me explain.

Iron Keep:  I have defeated Smelter and the main boss, yet, i still have summoning signs in Iron Keep.  I touch the sign, the phantom is summoned and guess what else, the bosses FOG GATE is back.  So i go thru the Fog Gate and no boss because i have already beat him.  I go to another world where i have defeated all the bosses and again i have summoning signs around.  ABSURD.

On top of that i have been invaded in these worlds by other players, wait, i beat the boss can u still invade me?  To add insult to injury im a hollow with no boss in the world.  The Pursuer invade me constantly in Iron Keep which i have yet to figure out why.  We fight then he will disappear before i can kill him, smh.

Using a Bow is a joke.  I have 25str 30dex and 105 agility, more than enough to use a Long Bow.  After shooting 2 arrows my green bar is depleted.  The core mechanics of the game is gone.  Leveling, repairing at your bonfire was SWEET.  The feel of being in control of your fate is gone.  In DK-1 the feeling of the world is on your shoulders was ever present, not so in DK-2.

The worlds feel generic at best eg, The gutter and black gulch i guess supposed to be like Blight Town in DK-1 and the other poison swamp in demons souls.  well it fails.  When you entered Blight Town in DK-1 and the Swamp in demons souls, you had the feeling of OMG what is this!!! When i go to the gutter and the Gulch something is missing.  All the worlds so far feel tacked on, unfinished.

Why did they put swarms of enemies everywhere?  DK-1 had swarms but they were well placed.  DK-2 swarms is just thrown at you in a cheap way everywhere.  Going to Londo in DK-1, the knights on that ledge with the great bows, lol, that was cheap and fun, but it was the only cheap aspect in the game IMO. if we are faced with swarms of enemies they should make Human Effigy more available.

Why we cant get Effigy after killing a Boss?  Why we can't turn back to human if we are hollow after killing a Boss?  These 2 issues are game breakers for me.

There are other issues but at this point it don't matter.  I will finish my play thru and most likely will not go for NG+.  I just don't have that feeling like i had with demons souls and dark souls-1.

Edit 3/24

I am Level 140 now.  I may not finish my first play thru.  LET ME EXPLAIN:

I played Demons Souls and DK-1 over 1000 hours with 8 characters combined.  I have NEVER had a weapon BREAK in any of the previous souls like in DK-2 with the exception of Katana's.

Every weapon i have used between level 120 - 140 and i have well over 30, has BROKEN before i reach the BOSS.  This is ABSURD.  Even after using Repair Dust if i go thru a swarm of enemies by the time im done fighting them my weapon durability has dwindled to 50% or less, any weapon, smh.  I do not know if its because im fighting so many enemies or what but this is crazy.  Every area i go thru its costing me about 3000 or more souls just to repair my equipment.  Maybe they lowered the weapon durability to compensate for carrying 3 weapons in each hand.  if that is the case, its another CHEAP TACTIC that FS has implemented.  There are too many CHEAP TACTICS in this game.  The biggest cheapo is getting invaded as a hollow, even if the BOSS has been defeated and you have 25% to 50% less HP than the invader.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

From Software, PLEASE change these game breaking CHEAP TACTICS.

This game need a lot of fixing.  I started playing DK-1 again.  I am done with DK-2 until they fix all the issues.

EDIT..7/3/14

Ok, after all the patches some of my complaints have been addressed.  However, the targeting/lock-on is a JOKE.  Example...when locking on a target and you are using, say an ultra GS, your swings are completely off target.  I tried this using the Pursuers, Zweihander and other comparable swords.  I noticed when i lock on a target with these swords, my attack will somehow swing either to the left or the right.  REALLY!!!!!  You may get one hit and then for some CRAZY reason the second and third swing is completely off.

Another example of the broken lock-on are the giant knights in the Ancient Dragon area.  These Knights will lock onto you as if they know your exact next move.  Example...the knight body movement is looking to the left, meaning he is moving to the left and you are on his right, for some STRANGE reason he will hit back to the right, even though his body/head is facing the left.  He will hit you not even looking at you.  But the BIGGEST cheap tactic these knights have is their UNLIMITED STAMINA.  OMG, these knights will throw multiple combos at you say 5 or 6 in a ROW with hammers. This was the breaking point for me.  I have my character at SL 400 NG++.  I will not go any further all i do now is co-op helping other players.  PATIENTLY waiting for Dark Souls 3.

Bandai Namco, in a Square-Enix fashion, managed to shred good memories into pieces by changing the battle formula, the main characters, creating time wasting dungeon puzzles and ridiculously hard random enemies.

About the story, it is 2 years after the dawn of the new world after the party in the original game regenerated and reunited the two worlds. However, in good old RPG manner, there were disputes and discrimination in the new world (which they dealt with already with the Desians in the old game) that the world is far from being united. To even make things worst, the original hero Lloyd Irving seemed to have become the biggest villain in this game. When you were thinking ""What the?"" the game introduced the two most annoying main characters in Tales history - Emil and Marta. Emil basically sulk throughout the game and acted like an idiotic coward. Every time he opens his mouth, you just want to fast forward the cut scenes. As for Marta, although she was supposed to have a greater mission, all the things she said in the game seemed to just want to get laid with Emil. It is extremely frustrating when you need to listen to those conversation again and again after each battle without an option to switch of the dialogues at all. Seriously if Bandai Namco wants to pay homage to the original game, might as well just make a sequel with the same cast tell about their after stories. The two main characters are so unlikable that you just couldn't really be bothered to find out what happened to them.

Adding to that was a completely unrewarding battle and party system. The battle system stayed true but now the party only consists of the two main characters with a Pokemon style recruitment system. The thing is if they actually follow the Pokemon or even the Persona formula, it will be a great system. But then it didn't. Monsters fight with you in real time and evolve, but the AI and strategy controls are so limited you basically have no control over them. Unison attacks all look similar with limited variation so you don't really know whether it is a new move until you look at the name of that move. When monster evolved they reduced back to level 1 and lose their skills (which they can acquire later when they level up again). Now cooking became a means to evolve them and increase their stats but then if you already have leveled up monsters it might be best to stay put and just increase their stats instead of evolving them. So eventually it lost the whole purpose of recruiting new monsters because they all join you at level 1 and required substantial ""wait-in-line level up"" before you can deploy them into battles.

Dungeons in Tales of Symphonia are ingenious and yet challenging. In Dawn of the New World, they are just mere existence for extending gameplay without much value adding to the game. You are repeating all the block pushing and button pressing and that's all. So they make it a lot in each dungeon so you can enjoy listening to the same sound effects again and again for two to three hours. Not because they are difficult to solve but they are so large scale that you just need to run around doing similar things again and again. And to make this even more ""challenging"" they have random enemies that can kill all your party in two or three hits. In one of the dungeons, you need to pick up one of the key cards in one of the rooms, but then suddenly they have random enemies that can cause around 700 damage each hit at a point of the game that 3 hits you'll be dead. To make things worse, Bandai Namco took away the easy on the fly character switching system and replaced it with a complicated and user-unfriendly nun-chuck and Wiimote system that you need a PhD to master it freely. So while you are busily trying to heal and revive your characters, you lost control of all your characters instead.

Dawn of the New World has such potential to be a RPG that Wii owners who love the previous Cube game can embrace it whole-heartedly. But changes to the game just make it a very forgettable game that if you are fans of the old game should strictly stay away. Even the cameo appearance of the original cast won't be able to save it cause the game is overrun by level 99 annoying main characters, cheesy dialogue and exhaustive and uninteresting gameplay.","If you can't make a better sequel, don't!",1262304000,11,,

3. How can I use stealth to kill a Nazi scientists that always stays in the same area and has plenty of Nazis watching his back? That last mission was the one that made me give up and go back to Fallout 4.

In conclusion, this game had a lot of potential but I should have listened to the negative reviews. Yes, killing people in exotic locations always turns me on, but the controls are too clunky, the choices are too few.

As far as gameplay, it's not much of an improvement. The striking is ok, the grappling is weird and you constantly get frozen in positions for a short time which just makes everything look awkward. Apparently nobody knows how to throw anything but slow motion hammer fists on the ground.

EA also still hasn't figured out what a knock out is or when a fight should be stopped. You can literally fold someone in half against the cage, as their lifeless body just kind of slides to the ground. Then they will miraculously come back to life, all while the ref looks on doing nothing. Honestly you have absolutely no idea when you knock someone down whether they are out cold, hardly hurt, or badly stunned. You mostly have to just wait and see if they reanimate, or listen to Rogans comments for clues. WTF EA. If a fighter is knocked limp and lifeless, the fight is over.

here are the cons. there is no player creator that i am aware of. kinda sucks because i know all my friends would love to create themselves in a basketball game and asign himself to his favorite team. secondly, the gameplay is bad. playing defense is a hassle unless you steal the ball from the cpu which isn't hard at all. its pretty much impossible to block a dunk or win the tipoff on any difficulty.

I can not believe how bad the beginning of this game is.  It ruined the game for me.  By the time I got to my first fight, roughly two hours in, I was already ready to trade the game in for something....anything else.
You will spend the first couple hours of this game slowly walking from one part of the map to another.  You get to one side, someone tells you to go to the other.  You get to the other, someone tells you to go back.  You do this over and over.
The mechanics of the game this early are also horrible.  At one point you need to go to a house on cliff and the path to the house is hidden between two houses.  At another point you have to lay 3 stone pieces on a column.  There is no button to lay them, so I had to move the stone pieces around for ever until the game decides the are in the proper place and it lays them for you.  This is maddening when the pieces are perfectly lined up, yet the game will not place them.  And I kept going until I got to that first fight, hoping the game would get better with the battles.  But it doesn't.  The system in antiquated.
But the worst thing about the beginning of the game is that you are stuck with two of the worst characters I have ever encountered in a game as party members.  Keifer is a spoiled brat who is one of the reasons you are running all over the map.  You are basically his slave, disguised as a ""friend"".  He is annoying.  Super annoying.  But he is the most awesome character ever compared to Maribel.  Honestly, if the game let me, I would kill her, reload, kill her again, reload, kill her again.  That seems to me to be the only possible enjoyment this game could offer.  She pops up univited, forces herself into your party, and never misses an opportunity to tell you what a giant jerk you are.  Seriously, it is constant.

Maybe the game eventually turns into this ""charming masterpiece"" so many people claim it to be.  But I read it takes 20+ hours before you can even choose a class.  And honestly, the ""slave"" class you seem to start in got tiresome before the first, simplistic battle.
But I refuse to go deeper.  I refuse to play a game that saddles me with two of the most annoying characters ever.

In retrospect, I don't like FFXII because it is an RPG/RTS hybrid, and the two genres didn't mesh well here.

  Pros:

  - Most of the in game functions take place using the touch screen, as
  it should be

  - You get to summon classic FF monsters to aid you in battle (and most
  of them don't just vanish after launching one attack)

  - You play as a band of pirates (arr!) who are searching for treasure
  (and will inevitably end up saving the world if Square follows its
  usual storyline)

  - All of the maps are strewn with treasure chests

  - Unlike in Fire Emblem, you don't permanently lose a party member if
  they die in battle

  Cons:

  - The random nature of some of the characters.  One of them is a
  crocodile.  Why?

  - No squad system to make controlling your armies simple.  Instead, you
  have to do a square select to control multiple units.  And this becomes
  a pain when you have large armies.

  - If all party members die its game over, an RPG element that is really
  annoying in an RTS.

  - You command your army using the touch screen, but most maps are so
  huge that it takes forever to go and issue a command.

  - You have to go and select the spawn points in order to summon new
  monsters, and then you have to give them orders once they spawn.

  - At the start of each battle, you can only select 5 monsters to summon
  during the battle

  - Player AIs.  All of your AIs, including your own party, are pacifists
  that will stop attacking if you aren't spamming the attack order via
  the touch screen.  So if you have to go do something off screen, your
  units become completely useless.

  - The above flaws make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to go
  after the treasure chests without losing.

The Good Side: What to expect out of the Re-Elected version? Every piece of DLC that was released on the PS3 plus the game Gat out of Hell.

Gate out of Hell: You've heard my complaints about the Re-Elected version of Saints Row IV. Now comes my thoughts on Gat out of Hell. It has a nice premise, but frankly speaking, this should have been the new Saints Row of the generation. Make it longer and give people the chance to stomp on the minions of Hell as Johnny Gat, yes please. But I found it a bit too dark visually.

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:

""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one.

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...

This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and then in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. There are a lot of other more technical reviews which go into much more detail over on the page for the stand-alone game.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums (I was one of them). Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

Then 6 whole months later, after they finally figured out that the CU did indeed suck, they let loose the NGE. They released it just two days after releasing the Obi-Wan expansion which had ""special items"" for classes that were about to disappear. 32 professions reduced to 9. The NGE is the final nails in the coffin of this game. It totally destroyed it. It became some sort of a twisted MMO/FPS wannabe. Fake and cartoony and dumbed down to where a 5 year old could figure out how to mash the buttons. It is so bad that even Smedly himself said that it wasn't good. And a recent developer conference in Austin the quote was ""learn from our mistakes"". It's widly rumored that the game will be ""sunset"" soon (they're gonna pull the plug on it). This ""Complete"" (I'm feeling sick here) edition is their last ditch effort to milk a little more cash out of it before it's all over.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are empty. People have moved on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

I regret giving up my Xbox 360 with a decent collection of games (including Kinect-enabled ones) - because there is still a huge gap between the games available for the One and 360. As an example, Limbo debited 3+ years ago on Xbox 360, and it just came out on Xbox One. I enjoyed Fruit Ninja over 2 years ago, and it's still not available for Xbox One!! Such a let-down.

Please explain why they made a new console that won't play Xbox 360 games? That's really stupid, and I have only myself to blame because I trusted Microsoft to port existing games quickly, since they've decided to break compatibility on purpose.

I would also like to point out that Xbox One games/apps are sluggish despite the up-to-date hardware. For example, Xbox Fitness is absolutely painful to use, as it loads a full minute (which feels like an eternity) and all animations and transitions are horribly rough.

Another source of frustration is the dashboard UI. Browsing for games (which I do frequently, hoping to find something interesting) is very confusing?! It's either one flat list of all games, or poorly defined categories with very limited number of titles. And I can't still figure out how to rate and review games/apps...

Finally, the prices for games for purchase on the console (downloadable) are regularly ~2 times higher than same titles on a disc (e.g. Amazon). That's just a shameless rip-off.

First, the mouse has a bad design on the right side buttons. These buttons are locating at the place where you put your ring finger. It is hard to move the mouse in a game without miss clicking on these right side buttons. The other choice is to put your ring finger on the top side, and only use your thumb and your pinky finger to grab the mouse and control. This way is very uncomfortable for a DOTA 2 gamer like me, the mouse if full of my sweat after a 15 min game-play.

Second, the right click button is tough!!!! I was using a Logitech G302(Daedalus Prime) before this Taipan. Compared to G302, this right click button is trash. It is never easy to click during fast moving because the button is just as inferior as the ones on those cheap mice which are less than $10.

Last, the sensor that Razer put inside this Taipan is SO STUPID. The sensor wants to make users ' feel slippery and hints of random acceleration '. However, it comes out that the mouse has a several milliseconds delay on the beginning of every move, which let you feel like the acceleration system is ON. This is definitely a FAILURE DESIGN since for every mouse user, they definitely expect the mouse movement to be a hundred percent under control. We do not need ANY RETARDED FEELING from the hardware or software.

2) Minimal endgame - its a joke
3) Theme-park style game play
4) Gestapo-nazi-esq forum moderation to hide the truth
5) Game engine is a 3rd party pile of junk. The fact it still running DX9 when DX11 is already out pretty much explains everything. Game engine is unable to handle more than 50ish people in a shard/instance etc and thus must be split up (even in fleet)
6) Economy is non-existent
7) Arcade on rails ""space-battles"" is a sick joke
9) Dev's are clueless and disconnected
10) PVP is a joke
11) Crafting is nonexistent
12) Classes are completely imbalanced

The camera controls are especially heinous by binding movement to the analog stick and camera to the D-pad. This may not sound too bad if you have two left thumbs, but for those of us with normal digits, it causes enemies, which constantly bolt back and forth across the field, to get out of your FoV with the only way to turn is to stand still and operate the D-pad. There is a lock on function, but because of the speed many enemies move, they frequently break the lock on and leave you staring at a wall. This is especially noticeable with a dragon-type boss very early on who has 8 different target spots but you'll never hit any of them because of how often it rips across the screen, leaving you to chase after it just so it can do it again and plow into you.

Normally broken controls would be enough, but the difficulty, dear god the difficulty. You'll be effortlessly hacking your way through groups of enemies, despite the camera, only to come onto a boss who will kill you before you even realize you're taking damage.

Sadly, the rest of it is rather fun. The sci-fi fantasy style of the game is interesting and the combat, when enemies are actually where you can see them and aren't insta-killing you, is quite enjoyable.

I've come across games like this that look good, sound good, seem good BUT just are not fun to play.  The weird button mashing - counter intuitive - controls in this game leave me bewildered.

Sticking is almost impossible.

I  bought the xbox version as it seemed most familiar for a sports game to me.  It's maddening to perfect a pass and shoot in the correct direction.  It's very hard to use the the right stick to select the ""off-defender or pass"" player.

Goal shooting is absolutely random - even in first person view.  Ball just goes off in any direction.

I played soccer from the time I was 5 until.. about 25... I know the game well and I know XBOX controls almost as well!

I'm generally a HAPPY reviewer here on amaz but please skip this series this year.

Gaming is in a funk these days!  There have been so many technical advances in gaming recently YET so many counter intuitive - counter fun - NUTTY decisions are being made by developers and publishers.

As a counter measure to any fenboi..  I should not need 7 hours of learning simple controls!

1.0,False,"01 26, 2010",A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B000BI5HZY,The Cool Guy,"This is by far the worst game I have ever played. I read all the reviews first, but being the Romero fan that I am, I bought it anyway. Boy, was that a mistake! I loved the movie ""Land of the Dead"", and was willing to accept the limitations of a movie tie-in game. But that's one of three main problems with this game. It hardly ties in to the movie at all.

The only resemblance to the movie is an appearance by a Dennis Hopper lookalike, toward the end. You are supposedly cleaning out Fiddler's Green. Could have fooled me! It looks nothing like the movie. Your hero bears no relation to the movie at all. He's a John Wayne-looking redneck farmer. Probably not your first choice for an Avatar, but you take what you get, right?

Imagine about a dozen of the most generic shooter levels you can think of. Then, scramble them up in random order, toss them together with a flimsy story, and go. The results? Awful! That's the second horrible thing about this game - the level design. To say ""generic"" is an insult to respectable generic cereal everywhere (which I love to eat). You have your hospital, sewer, street, etc. And don't even get me started about the random stacks of hay bales conveniently forming a maze(?). Repetitive, to say the least.

But by far the worst thing about the game is the glitchy controls and programming. It takes 4 hits (sometimes 6 or 8) to kill a zombie. Their heads may blow up at random, but that seems to have nothing to do with where you shoot. They are repetitive, and annoying.

The worst is how the enemies spawn. You ALWAYS know when an enemy is near, because the moment they spawn, the screen jerks for a moment. There can be nothing onscreen, but the screen jerks, and that tells you a monster is coming. Pathetic.

The only things the game got right was the limited ammo, forcing you to conserve. You HAVE to learn melee attacks in order to survive. This was the only satisfying thing, hitting a zombie in the head with a golf club or pipe.

I also liked one moment when you have to snipe to help a buddy. But between the boring, monotonous levels, those kind of moments are few and far between.

The game is dark and bleak. Which is fine for a horror game. Only this one also adds in ugly level design and glitches, for a truly joyless gaming experience. Other people say this game is fun. I disagree. It is wretched.

I spent a lot of money on it, so I stuck with it. And when I wanted to quit, I decided to finish anyway. But I sold it immediately afterward, and I'm the kind of guy who NEVER sells games. To say there is no replay value is an understatement.

I never tried the multiplayer. I don't think I would want to spring this game on my worst enemy.

Don't be taken in by the good reviewers here. They are still in denial, trying to rationalize the money they wasted on this game. They're not yet ready to face the truth, which is a painful experience, I know.

Plus, the fact that this game keeps getting more and more expensive may make you think it is a collector's item. Don't believe it!!! Learn from my experience, fellow Zombie lover! Just because it's got Romero's name on the front does not warrant your purchase, trust me!

So if you like to spend lots of money and you like horror games, MINUS the fun, then by all means, buy this! Otherwise, I would highly recommend purchasing ""The Thing"". It is a horror survival movie tie-in game that they actually got RIGHT for a change.

1.0,False,"09 10, 2014",A307Y71ISNV9HD,B00EFRN2IQ,Nudeyman,"Let me start out by saying: I am profoundly dumbfounded and bewildered about how evil this company has become since my childhood. Seriously, words need a poet to describe how utterly evil and destructive to the gaming industry EA has become over the last 12 or so years. This is a company that is buying out all the rights (using money they made from making groundbreaking, legendary games in the past that Maxis influenced) to publish any game having to do with Professional sports, college sports and simulation games just to name a few. I wouldn't care less if that was the end of the story, however, Now they are now almost done buying out the entire industry, EA is churning out the most lazily programmed, bland, boring and predictable games using ideas almost 2 decades old.
I grew up with playing the Sims. I started with 1 in middle school and moved up to what I think is the pentacle of the series Sims 2 in high school. I bought every expansion pack for it using money I had saved for months. Almost my whole summer of 2006 was devoted to staring at the computer screen for hours upon hours. The days seemed to meld into each other. Then my first year of college, Sims 3 made its debut. I was heartbroken. It seemed like all the heart and soul had been vaccumed out of the series. The best items where put behind a pay wall by EA. Additionally, even the most bleeding edge processors at the time could not handle the strain Sims 3 put on them. So I lost almost all interest in the Sims until very recently (2014) when affordable technology was just catching up to the programming of Sims 3.

Now we are living in the future playing the 4th installment of this game and I couldn't be more disappointed. They ripped out all the innovative and fun things that made Sims 2 and 3 unique and left in all of the bad parts. I guess the programmers decided if they couldn't program a working, real-time, breathing town the first time, they might as well give up. I guess they were afraid that if they couldn't get the new Simcity (a dedicated city builder) to work right, then making it work for Sims that had 24 hour schedules was just too hard. As another reviewer on amazon said about it, EA knows you are going to spend the money on it anyway. Which I think hits the nail on the head. Also of course just as last time, buying the old expansion packs doesn't mean anything and are not in any way compatible with Sims 4. The graphics seem similar enough from Sims 3 that you should be at least be able to import items, if not Sims and properties from 3. So I guess if you want to have the whole Sims 4 experience you are going to have to shell out another $500 dollars and wait another 4 years for the expansion packs. Not to mention the money you are going to be spending on all the good items EA puts behind an ONLINE PAY WALL. All that on top of dropping $70 on one of the most expensive production games in history. Let me tell you this game is not worth $70. Its not even worth buying for $40 in my opinion.

Sure there are a couple of new things to this edition. Sims can muti-task (if told to). The create-a-sim tools are slightly more user friendly and powerful, and Sims seem to an extent more social and interesting. (Rather than constantly sitting on their ass watching TV or computer games literally all day long before they starve half to death and wet their pants.) Beyond that, I don't see why anyone would like this edition over 2 or 3. (or even 1).

In closing, if I had any stock at all in EA I would be selling it. If I had any money I would be buying it short. This is a company that is destroying its own game franchises almost on a level of sabotage, over charging for new games we've played years ago, and insisting that you put more money into a game that you have already purchased to make it remotely playable for good measure. If this is now the level at which these guys produce games now, I don't see Sims 5 or Simcity 5 being nearly successful as its predecessors in this lifetime.

1) Roster is still not updated. You would think with all the NBA Today features they implemented in the game, they would at least keep us updated with the current roster. Not the case. Rose is still with the Bulls, Kobe with the Lakers. But, at least we can watch last night's highlights on NBA Today, which are obviously more important than a roster update.

2) Whistle-mania. There is a whistle for everything. Next Gen sweat drops to the floor, whistle! Player coughs, whistle! Player sneezes, whistle! Driving for a lay up will automatically result in a whistle and free throws up. Get ready to set the TV to mute if you want to play the game. Because the whistles will have your ears ringing after a while.

3) LeBron 2K14. That, I think, is the right title for the game. I do not care that LeBron is unstoppable in the game, but why should others be transformed to crap. I chose the Lakers on numerous occasions, and I do not know how Kobe air balls wide open shots, but Nick Young can hit a fade away three. Kobe cannot shoot for crap in the game. Brick, after brick. All the points I scored with Kobe came from the free throw line, or lay ups. Kobe will not make one perimeter shot. LeBron 2K14 was made for LeBron.

4) Running the offense. 2K thinks it is important to keep changing the play calling. I do not know why, but they feel it makes the game ""new"". Try running a post up, and you will be prompted to select from a menu screen that shows up during play, a list of possible options, that you need to toggle between left and right, up and down, then left and right again...Seriously, 2K? You think that I'm going to keep reading all the options, while my point guard is trying to protect the ball, in order to run a simple post up play? Too confusing and impractical.

Instead of running through zones to get to Eggman, Sonic has to rescue birds called Flickies from Eggman's robots to proceed. I'm fine with rescuing birds even if it is a bit strange (although the idea was also in Sonic Adventure). What I do not like about the game is how weak it is. The graphics are not in 3D at all, they are simply set at an 3/4 overhead view similar to Zelda and Super Mario RPG. They are good for the Genesis, but if you want to see better consider getting the Saturn version. The soundtrack is weak, repeats a lot, and normally does not fit the zones very well. Again, if you want an amazing musical score you should get the Saturn port. After the terrible music was muted I found the controls were VERY slippery. I tried it with the standard D-Pad and found it was almost impossible to change direction. Using a joystick is not much better. The controls, aside from not having a proper configuration, have bad traction. Along with the dreadful music and controls is the boss fights. Eggman has been and always will be a wimp, but he hardly is trying in 3D Blast. Normally it is the terrain that supplies the hazards while Eggman flys around shooting something at you.

Drake's Fortune was great and Among Thieves only got better. So when I got 3, I was so ready to dive into Nate's world once again. However I was extremely disappointed. While I understand that animation changes as time goes by, which explains the slight differences in Chloe, Nate, and Sully (though I really think the teeth had a lot to do with it on the boys) there was no excuse for Elena. She had a completely different face. When she first appeared, the only thing that even gave me a clue it was her was the hair. I wasn't even sure it was her until she started talking and I recognized the voice. Her face looks NOTHING like it did in 1 and 2. 1 and 2 were both amazing and kept you on the edge of your seat while you played, no matter how many times you played. They were both fascinating and hard to put down, although parts of 1 were hard to play at night. Creepy. I had no such problems with 3. While it was great to see the origin of how Nate and Sully met and their relationship grow, as well as see his relationship with Elena, the game itself did not hold my interest like the others. In this game, Nate has a beyond irritating habit of touching every single thing he's near: walls, carts, cars, whatever, he touches it. He didn't do that in the first two, he didn't need to do it in the third. Also super high on my list of annoying Nate qualities, in this game, he runs like an idiot. In 1 and 2 he ran like a normal person. There was no need to mess with that for 3. But they did, and so he runs like an idiot. He's also harder to control. I find myself having to hit a command multiple times before he actually does it, (and it has nothing to do with my controller). He doesn't always pull out his gun as soon as a bad guy pops up which is frustrating. It's harder to control him jumping onto something when he's swinging. Whenever he's swinging, it doesn't matter if I hit the jump button when he's in the right position or not because he will jump off and fall to his death for no reason so it winds up taking 15 minutes to get him to move 20 feet.

The graphics are good, which you expect after playing one of the others in the series. The banter was decent, as was the sarcasm. The storyline was okay, but not as interesting as you'd expect after playing the first two. There are sections of the game that are pretty decent, like the boat and the airfield. It's a good game, if you play it as a stand alone. If you compare it to the first two, it's lacking. Especially in the extras/bonuses department. 2 had a ton of stuff, like unlimited ammo, your choice of guns, skins, etc. 3 had none of that. While 1 and 2 get 5 star reviews because they're both awesome and phenomenal, Uncharted 3 only gets 1 star from me overall because after playing the first two, this one was a total let down.

Even in standard composite video, you can see small areas where its slightly checkered. Needless to say, but I returned this the day I received it. I rated this 1 star because out of all the third party cables I have purchased, this one has the most obvious checkerboard effect of all and actually managed to detract from the gaming experience because of it.

If you're looking for a good Snes/N64/Gamecube S-video cable without having to pay the Monster Cable premium, (at time of writing, it can be found for $70-100) I suggest going with importing an Official Nintendo S-Video cable from Japan. It is dedicated, (meaning no composite hookup)has Nintendo first party quality, and will cost you around $25-35 depending on condition.

I have been playing the piece of crap for the last 3 days becuase I have nothing else except the games I have already beaten. The backdrops and views are great, and that is about as far as it goes. It takes about an hour to hour and a half to just be able to actually do anything interesting. The Italian Accent and dialouge is pitiful. I think that the designers were trying to draw you in but teh only thing good about the cut-scenes is it gives you a chance to leave and use the bathroom, or get a drink. The Controls are horrible. If you are running by a ladder and anywhere near it Enzio wil hop on it but when you need to reach the next ledge while climbing you can pretty much bet on Enzio just jumping off the building altogether. there is a dream sequence where you have to climb a tower and the camera pans around and shows you where to go, but it will take you forever becuase Enzio just plain out refuses to climb the thing. The controls are what make me the angriest. You will find yourself wondering why you are still playing. And as far as repetition, well It is still pretty much the same thing go kill these guys silently go kill these guys loud, now go pickpocket this guy. Really boring. But I will say this I have been playing for a long time and I think I am close to the end finally, but the game does have some length.

I made the comment that cables appear ""rugged enough for their intended use""... but I may be wrong... it appears the wiring inside the cables is very cheap and thin... the microphone stopped working after only two weeks of use.

Sadly, the game utterly fails to deliver on that promise.

I would start by saying the graphics are last-gen but last-gen graphics would surely be insulted by such a statement. Characters and environments remind me of shooters from 8 or 10 years ago, no joke.

Sound was hit and miss, with the weapons fire/effects being pretty good but voice acting being horrible. In the interest of realism, NPCs call you by a nickname you choose from a list. ""Good idea, poor execution"" is this game's mantra as the result sounds more like a voice you might hear on an automated phone menu: ""Your hold time is- 'five' -minutes"". The straw that broke my patience's back was the incessant panting your character produces, even after only one or two steps.

Even worse is the frustratingly sluggish gameplay. Movement is jarring and imprecise. When starting to move from a standstill, your character must first ""wind-up"" in a fashion I simply cannot describe. The accompanying screen jerk made me want to vomit from motion sickness. Maneuvering in tight quarters simply isn't possible. The menu system is shockingly overcomplicated- actions as simple as changing weapons require a series of clicks and the resulting animation takes forever. The hit detection is an absolute farce- it took me 8 tries to hit a stationary cardboard tank with a rocket launcher from only a few feet away- the game simply did not recognise the first 7 hits.

The real knife in the back has to be the ""campaign,"" which is actually just more ""training"". You shoot ""bad guys"" (your allies dressed in costumes) with paintballs and the cheesy ""drill instructors"" follow you around, barking your objectives.

The configuration software for this mouse, Razer Synapse, requires an internet connection. You must submit and verify your email address with the program to use it. Then, it sends information about you and your computer to Razer, and continues to run as an always-online data-mining surveillance application.

Razer mentions an offline mode on their website, but there is no such thing. It's a placebo to placate criticism of their activities. You can not register the software offline, and you can not use it without registering.

If you uninstall the software, features of the mouse stop working.

In my case, all I wanted to do was to turn off the LEDs and set one of the side buttons to be the middle-mouse button, but I can't do that without giving Razer my email address (for spam/marketing purposes), sending the unique serial number of the device, and associating that serial number to my IP email address, name, mailing address, a list of all software installed on my computer, and probably much much more.

Let's create a Strategy Game in which the player doesn't get to decide where his characters stand or what they do.  And even if the player DOES get to choose a good option the character might decide to ""Reassess"" and do something else anyway.  This game is more based on random events than any kind of strategy.  I'll try to keep this brief because I already wrote a 4 page blog about all the things that piss me off about this game.

This is how the battle system works in Last Remnant.  You are given up to 6 different options for each team you control.  These options are pretty much entirely random.  You will have the option to heal yourself when you have full health.  You won't be given options to heal yourself when you need to sometimes.  You will not get the option to resurrect your other teams when you need to.  You will have 300 Action Points available, but none of your attack options will be available except a normal attack or using only one of your weak Combat Arts.  Your characters will decide on their own not to do what you told them if they feel like learning a new random ability at that moment instead.

When you get to the very end of the game where you are trying to kill the god-like bosses, the fights have the frustrating feeling of not having any real say in what happens at all.

It spent about 30 minutes in the system before my kids turned it off in frustration, and we spent 20 of those minutes simply trying to set up in-game avatars for them.

This game is terrible because the Kinect is terrible. I am so sick of the Kinect. It sucks. Its a failure. I should have learned my lesson with the atrocious Kinect Star Wars, but no. My fault. The biggest problem with Kinect is that 99% of its games are designed for kids but it requires the patience & precision of an adult to use. If you are old enough to get around all of its annoying quirks, you are not going to be interested in playing the kiddie Kinect games. If, like my kids, you are age appropriate for the games, the Kinect will be a frustrating obstacle to gameplay and youll be switching back to a controller-operated game after a few minutes.

Anyway, this specific game is for up to two players, and is supposed to scan them into the Pixar world with the Kinect camera. It vaguely does that. The avatar it made for one of my kids looked a little bit like him but not really. You can change some of the avatars features manually, but the Kinect menu interfaces are so frustrating to use we skipped that. The Kinect flat out refused to scan in my other son. At one point you have to stand up straight with your arms & legs spread out, inside a green outline. My son did that, several times but the Kinect refused to register his knees or elbows. It only gives you a few seconds to complete this scan before popping up an error message and forcing you to start the process all the way over again from the beginning. We spent most of our time slogging through this process and I wanted to snap the Kinect in half.

Then we got to the actual game, which wasn't much better than navigating the menus. Kids tend to jump around as they try to have fun with the game, but the Kinect penalizes you for that. My kids would get too far forward or too far right or left, and they had a lot of trouble with the controls. The gameplay is also repetitive and confusing. You run your avatar around with characters from various Pixar movies and are presented with puzzles, sometimes given with no hints. That would be all right for an adult, but its not fun for a 5-year old. One puzzle involved having to jump up on a little raised platform, and the controls are so awful my kids were not able to do it. Theyd either jump past it, over it, or theyd jump and the Kinect wouldnt recognize they were jumping.

If you want a fun Kinect game for your kids, get Kinect Party. Even if you manage to get through the avatar creation menus in Kinect Rush, there is no reward waiting for you in playing the actual game. Hopefully I can get a dollar or two for this junk on trade in.","Waste of time, just like the Kinect itself.",1418860800,,,

1.0,False,"01 10, 2006",A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B0000A1VEP,The Cool Guy,"This game went wrong in a lot of ways. Warlords III: Reign of Heroes and Dark Lords Rising were awesome games, nearly perfect in their execution. Warlords: Battlecry II was also in itself an incredible game.

Along comes Warlords IV, which tries to mix the two games, and fails miserably. Most of the cool features from Warlords III are gone, apparently in the name of ""simplification"". While a lot of the animations and sound effects from Battlecry II are ripped off the original game and presented here in a very stripped-down way.

I wanted to like this game, but it is just such a departure (in a bad way) from the two games that it is based off of. I have no problem with gaming innovation, but this isn't innovation. This is just plain bad programming.

As another reviewer stated, it really seems like the developers of this game ran into some budget problems and just ""threw it out there"", so to speak. The new warlord system just really stinks. And the heroes, which were so cool and played such an important part in both WL3 and Battlecry 2, are conspicuously weak in this game. They are all wimps! I don't know why they are even included in the game, because the moment you put them in a battle they are guaranteed to die right off the bat.

And the vectoring system which was so useful in WL3 is now absent. The units actually have to travel ON SCREEN from where they are produced. This is more realistic, perhaps, but it certainly calls for some micromanagement to make sure your units out wandering alone don't get slaughtered while you aren't looking.

The only good thing I could say about this game is that the graphics are somewhat improved from WL3. Even so, most of the animations are still just ripped directly off of Battlecry II, so we're not seeing anything innovative here. In fact, the graphics in Battlecry II beat this mish-mashed hodgepodge of a game by a long shot.

Besides, graphics alone does not a good game make. Warlords 3, while having graphics that are now showing their age, is a FAR superior game to this one. (And I STILL highly recommend it for turn-based strategy game lovers! WL3 is an excellent game indeed.)

This game was really disappointing. It shows a lot of potential with the ideas used, but the execution was horrible to say the least. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it.",Really Crappy Game,1136851200,6,,

EA screwed its customers once again and left out this feature.  They replaced with some retarded mini games that will only interest stat junkies that want all the achievements they can get.

Here is a list of problems I have encountered:

- Game locks up and freezes my brand new PS3 constantly, even when in single player mode.

- After a few hours of gameplay I encountered a crash so bad that I was greeted with a message saying my PS3 hard drive was corrupted, this has never happened before with any other games.

- Online game play is impossible.  Won't load, crashes, massive amount of glitches, stalls halfway through gameplay only to delete all progress made, other online players are often impossible to see making missions unachievable.

- After searching through hundreds of comments on GTA IV forums I can see this is an ongoing problem with MANY other customers.

- The game graphics are only fair at best.

- Characters are unispiring and quite boring, often times hard to understand without turning captions on.

- Missions are repetitive, dull and go nowhere.

I was able to get my pc up and running and decided to reload Homefront. When I put in the purchase code, I received a ""Duplicate Record Error"" and it suggested I contact Steam. I did contact them.

As a result, I simply gave up. Steam's support is simply designed to frustrate the user until they simply give up. That was my take-away from all of this.

You see, I used to be of the mind that every video game, no matter how bad, had at least one redeeming quality. Sure, Tenchu was slow and poorly animated, but it had neat backgrounds and was it occasionally (unintentionally) hilarious. And on I Ninja, the ""beat the clock"" missions sucked, but the ""kill everyone"" missions more than made up for it. Then I played this game. There was nothing redeeming about it. Nothing.

In fact, the only good thing about the game, an unlockable mode in which you fight solely against the game's bosses, mysterious disappeared shortly after I found it. The only other good thing about this game was the off button. (This was, of course, voted one of the top 3 worst games of all time on...some show.)

But what was bad about the game? Well, your enemies suck. They range from brainless idiots to masters of the martial arts. And sometimes, they change from one to the other on a whim. They all look the same. All the ninjas have the same outfit; it just changes color (blue for boys, red for girls). And there is the witty banter they assault you with, which ranges from, ""Let's teach him a lesson,"" to ""I think I'm in love.""

Bruce himself is pretty messed up. When he's fighting, he sounds like a chicken. When he's not, he sounds nothing like Bruce Lee. He also has the extremely useless and life threatening ability to lock on to a specific enemy from a horde of many. This allows him to block that specific enemy, while all the rest of them sneak up behind him and kick his butt. Hard. By the way, the block button was X. X is not a block button. X is an attack button. They couldn't even get that right.

I guess in an effort to show how much Bruce Lee looks like himself, the design team inflated his head a bit to make it stand out. That was kind of silly, but then again, so was the fact that Bruce changes his outfit every chance he gets. And not just from level to level. I mean when he starts chasing a ninja chick through pouring rain, he is wearing a Chinese style coat. But when he catches her he's shirtless. Then, the coat's back on. Where did he stick it, down his pants?

I've got to admit, I never liked Bruce Lee. I thought Enter the Dragon was boring. So I hoped that this video game would allow me to look at Bruce with a whole new light. It did. I am now even less in Bruce Lee's corner.",Bruce Lee's Head was Bigger than I Remembered,1104537600,4,,

1.0,True,"06 15, 2014",A3SMWBV1QHQ3AA,B004NRN5DU,Chris,"Simply stated: this is the *worst* video game I have *ever* played.

I'm going to qualify that by saying that there's a lot of good stuff in this game. The visuals are nice, the loot is engaging, and most of the enemy models are decent. And once you get the hang of combat, that part of the game becomes enjoyable. And then you turn a corner and there's some ridiculously powerful enemy that is entirely out of place with what you've been facing and it will kill you before you can ask, ""What the !@*# is that thing?""

You die a lot in the game. That actually seems to be a large part of the design: finding increasingly annoying ways to kill the player character. It's incredibly frustrating because you lose all souls (the game's only currency) and any humanity you may have. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you have a chance (read: exactly ONE chance) to regain whatever you lost. If you die again before you make it back to your lost power, you lose it for good and you can only regain whatever you lost this time. Since whatever killed you is likely far too powerful at the moment, this pretty much means that you're pretty much screwed.

It also doesn't help that the souls you lose are incredibly invaluable. They're the games *only* currency. You use them to purchase stuff and you use them to level up. That's right: at any given moment you have exactly one choice with what you can do with the souls you have. You can either use them to level up, or you can use them to buy equipment or upgrade materials. Since you lose your souls A LOT, this makes progress very slow.

And you're completely screwed if you die in a boss fight. Boss fights are typically engaged in some closed off room you can't escape, which means you can't just run in and grab your lost power and run out to fight another day. In order to be able to use what you get back, you have to survive the fight. You can counter-cheat the game by turning off your console the moment you die, before the game has a chance to autosave the fact that it just screwed you over. The next time you play, you get reset back to just before the boss fight. You still die, but your lost power is now outside the boss zone and you can get it back. I don't know why this isn't the default, because it makes the boss fights that much more frustrating.

Bosses are all idiotically large, with massive weapons that can hit from forever away, and they all hit stupid hard. There are some bosses that even randomly explode with area damage just to screw you over even more. There's one boss that wields two massive cleavers that are each as wide as the room he's in, and he can use a two-weapon attack that's unblockable and usually results in instant death. There's another demon boss that's in a basement room which he also fills up, and he uses a massive force wave attack that can't be blocked and kills the player character in two hits or less, and if you manage to get behind him he'll slam his weapon into the ground to cause an explosion that hits the PC *through the boss*. There's a giant wolf boss that carries an even more giant sword in its mouth, moves several times faster than the useless PC, has 4-5x the attack reach, and can even execute a spin move that will hit you twice with enough damage to kill you every time. These are unbelievably frustrating battles that seem to be designed by sadists that hate the entirety of the gaming community.

It's made even worse by the jackassery of the controls. The controller is incredibly unresponsive. Sometimes it can take a full second for the button you just pushed to actually register. A full second is enough time for you to die.

Even you manage to get your attack button pressed early enough, the animations are ridiculous. Want to swing that massive claymore? It'll take a while because you have to recover from swinging it or thrusting or whatever. But what about this light and nimble and supposedly faster scimitar? Nope, still takes a while because... erm... well... OH YEAH! You have to cock your arm first, and THEN you can swing at the enemy!! Most enemies will use the moment between you start an attack and when it should actually connect to start their own attack, which will usually connect first somehow. Even if your attack connects first, it won't interrupt most enemies unless it outright kills them, and their attack will still connect. And then you die. Again.

OK, how about just running away? That'll take a while too, seeing as how the PC has to lumber up to speed, even when unencumbered. And there's no ""sprint"". The jerk just kind of half-ass jogs along. Almost every enemy in the game can move faster, even if you've unequipped everything to lower your weight. Try to run away and they'll just catch up to you and back-attack you with their super-fast attacks that can hit you even when you're fleeing. And then you die. Again.

And if you try to dodge? Woah! It doesn't seem to matter what direction you hold the stick in, sometimes the PC will randomly dodge TOWARD the thing you're trying to get away from. And then you die. Again.

And the camera seems to somehow be a corporeal thing that tethers your character to the world. It will get stuck on various pieces of the environment and will whip around, completely changing the direction your character is facing, even if you've locked onto a target in combat or are trying to walk carefully across some narrow plank in an aerial environment. And then you die. Again.

Sometimes the uber-massive bosses can get between the camera and PC, resulting in the character not being able to move because the *camera* is stuck. This will happen even when you're in a big open space with no physical obstacles, and will prevent you from being able to get away from the boss' massive-damage-dealing attack. And then you die. Again.

I have NO idea how this game made it to market after playtesting. The developers must have taken what little positive feedback the playtesters could have given the game and removed those elements, as if to say that yes, they can in fact make the game worse. Either that, or the playtesters were all a bunch of brain-dead masochists who somehow think this is game actually represents a ""challenge"" instead of a straight-up ""screw you"" to the player.

This game will make you want to throw your controller, the console, and probably even your entire gaming setup including the chair out a very high window. The crash you'd hear is probably the only satisfying thing you can get out of this garbage. There was potential there, at some point, but the game's creators squandered all of that by utterly failing to understand the concept of ""reasonable challenge.""

I'm a completionist. I've played truly difficult games on their hardest settings just to get the achievements, because that's what I like to do. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but even so difficulty is not a thing for me. But this game isn't difficult. It's just asinine. But I'll probably still complete it through whatever twisted achievement-gobbling OCD I have. But to borrow a line from a movie, ""this will not be over quickly; I will not enjoy this.""

Since this review has earned me a LOT of flak, I figured I'd update it and give the rabid fan's that have been bombing me a little more information as to why I gave this atrocious game a 1 star review;

I was very excited about this game, excited to a point where I was rabidly following any update I could find. Like an addict, I had to get my fix. So to say that this game was unfulfilling is a polite understatement. This is a game that was so vastly disappointing to me that it's taken awhile to calm down enough to write about it.

Let's talk about the good things, because it will be brief. Aliens Colonial Marines started off on a good note. Sure, the graphics were disappointing after such a long development cycle, but it's forgivable, at first, because your just so bloody EXCITED to start playing. Again at first, it's good. It's atmospheric, it uses the sounds and lighting in great ways. You feel tense, and it's perfect. It's the kind of Aliens game that you've been waiting for.

Sadly, for single player, that's about where the good things end. Multi-player provides a decent experience, even if the weapons are terrible and the game types are dated. Imagine the multi-player as Left 4 Dead, where all the Zombies have been removed and you're just playing against special infected. It's fun, and it provides its thrills, but eventually you do start to feel drained by it.

As is typical for the more recent additions to the Aliens video games, this is simply another disappointment in a long string of disappointments. The game engine is weak, to a point where it's more common for the game to glitch out and break down than work properly. The weapons are terrible. Whats the point of being able to carry so many if they all suck?

At first the pulse rifle is pretty great, and in single player it is legitimately the go-to weapon. Things like the flame thrower, smart gun and turrets are a blast, but eventually, like everything else, they simply fall way short of the mark.

The AI is a disaster. The aliens in single player are so predictable that you can count on them to ALWAYS make a bee line for you unless your playing in co-op. Your `friendly' marine AI is so bad it almost seems like they take pleasure in watching you get mauled to death and they will literally watch an alien beat you to death without doing a single thing to save you.
Worse, you can actually shoot THROUGH your teammates as if they weren't there, and vice versa, the aliens can leap through the AI characters like they were phantoms. The hit boxes are a wreck, with the only consistent thing being that head shots don't count as head shots. Character animations are choppy, to be nice about it, and how they interact with the game world is so terrible that it's common for you to `trip' on a rough edge in a level and get insta gibbed by fall damage.

As for the story line, it's confusing to me that for the first 10 minutes, they get the recipe right only to have it just crash and burn. It's almost as if they intentionally worked only on the parts they would display for the previews, and just went `Meh, who cares.' I'll give you an example, and I'm sorry for the spoilers, but for the majority of the game, YOU DON'T EVEN FIGHT ALIENS.

For whatever asinine reason, most of this game is spent fighting the private militia of the Weyland-Yutani Corp. I guess having us play a game that's based on the premise of fighting Aliens was just too much for the good people at Gearbox/TimeGate Studios to handle. It's a move that had me shaking my head, because how did this make sense to anyone during development? `Lets make a game about fighting aliens, but you barely ever get to fight aliens.' Sure, sound plan, makes perfect sense.

Aliens Colonial Marines isn't just a disappointing game, because it's not simply bad, for a `game of passion,' that Gearbox was so utterly fanatic about, this is a travesty. It's a crappy game with the Aliens brand name slapped on top, a more blatant cash grab than I care to consider. This is nigh unforgivable. And to add insult to injury, insider leaks are pointing to the fact that Gearbox lied to us about how much control and work they actually put into the game. Important figureheads at Gearbox are on record saying that they were responsible for something like '80%' of the game, when in fact it turns out that they may have designed a level or two in Multi-player. Maybe. Turns out that TimeGate Studios has been in charge of this `hellish development cycle,' for years now, and they are responsible for making the majority of this game. Why lie about it? Well TimeGate has a rather dismal record when it comes to making games. You might remember them for, well, nothing really. They've never been able to produce a quality game, although to be honest, they have a really clever PR department.

At the end of the day, all my ranting boils down to two points; This game is awful, and the only redeeming factor about it is Multi-player, but even that is a tedious, glitchy and rage inducing affair. Do yourself a favor and rent this one if your really curious, I know from checking earlier today that Redbox is already carrying this. Regardless of whatever nostalgic feelings you might have towards this brand, this game utilizes the Aliens name as little more than a hollow gimmick to reel you in and steal your money. Honestly, this game is so bad it's not even worth the bandwidth required to pirate it.

For the folks giving me flak about the original review; Go look it up on Youtube you poor saps.

This was one of those early games that actually made multiplayer worth playing over and over again. It was very addictive and I continued to play it on and off until Starcraft 2 came out. Just to let you understand how valuable Starcraft 2 is, I was a late beta tester, a few months before release, now fast forward four years later, I am still playing it almost on a daily basis! Obviously my computer can now support this game at maximum settings with fast FPS. Over the years, I have seen Blizzard fine tune this game like no other games out there, ever getting so close to complete perfection. That's no surprise, this game has the highest standards out there, people are playing it professionally as a career and even casting the game professionally as a career. Although the game does have story-mode, Battle.net is the REAL focus of this game. All the units are carefully selected, tuned, and balanced by Blizzard. The units are all useful when making strategically decisions. I have seen Blizzard adding and removing units and abilities many times. All units have special characteristics that the players should master. This game is not about building up or earning something, you get good at this game from developing your own ability to play it. Players compete by their ability to control the game, make clever decisions, and outsmart each other. The graphics and animations are top-notice even for today's standards. Not only are the animations and visuals pleasing to look at, but they are artistically thought out with many attentions to small details. The artistic appeal will make SC2's visuals outlast all games that will come after it. Watch a flock of winged-zergling running across the map, or a fleet of carriers and tempest and you'll feel that swarm of bugs, or the endgame army. Honestly, I think the story-mode is a very small part SC2, but there is something for everyone. If you don't like to compete, you can play coop by vs. computer with other players or play custom maps. The gameplay is what keeps this game going so long. Every match I ever played feels different from the next. If you don't own this game, you can watch the casting videos, and there are thousands on Youtube, granted, you'll be more entertain if you play competitively, but it's always fun to watch the pros, and use their strategy against your next opponent. Obviously, I highly recommend this game + the expansions. It's a very VERY small price to pay for so many years of entertainment.

If you don't, avoid this game like the  plague.

I've never picked up an entry in the long-running Mario and Sonic Do A Sport Thing series, and for good reason. They've always kind of looked like kids' games. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you. There's always a place for kids' games. I mean, heck, Mario and Sonic's series are both basically for kids. It's just that they're generally good games, so anybody can enjoy them. But the Mario and Sonic Hit The Gym Jamboree franchise always looked like a certain type of kids' game. The kind of kids game full of trite mini-games, no depth, no content, and no reason to actually exist. But I guess, as somebody who likes Mario and loves Sonic, I was destined to cross paths in one way or another with one of these games. So why not this one?

Why not this one? Because Mario and Sonic's Rootin' Scootin' Way Past Cool 2016 Rio Olympic Games is one of the most fundamentally awful video games I've ever had the displeasure of suffering through. No, really. That's not a joke. I'm not just being harsh on a children's game. This is actually one of the most fundamentally garbage games on the 3DS, or any console for that matter. It may even be the worst game I've played that has Mario or Sonic in it. Think about that for a second. Worse that Mario Is Missing or Hotel Mario. Worse than Sonic Labyrinth or Sonic R. Think about that. Let it sink in. Done?

I'm not even sure where to begin with this one, folks. For starters, let's talk about the main brunt of the game: the story mode. Path to the Games? Road to the Gold? I don't know what it's called, I got rid of the thing over the weekend, but it was something like that. You pick a Mii, you choose a side, you do a ton of mini-games, you beat another mini-game, you buy a costume so you can do another mini-game, then you win that mini-game. After you win enough mini-games, you get to go to another map. Guess what you do on that map? You play. More. Freaking. Mini-games. That's it. That's all there is to it.

It doesn't matter if you side with Team Mario or Team Sonic, because you're going to have to do practically the same things. It just depends on which shallow interpretation of characters you want to spend multiple hours of your life talking to. Do you want to talk to princesses and turtles, or do you want to live out a DeviantArt member's wild furry fantasy? Your call. But honestly, they might as well be called Team Garbage or Team Bunghole, because they both stink. Not to mention the fact that it's basically the same mode as that really bad Mario Golf that hit the 3DS a few years back. Just a longer, and with more artificial difficulty. Because if there was one thing I wanted more of from Mario Golf, it was playing as a stupid Mii.

I would go into the mini-games specific to the story, and how bad they are, but I'll go straight into talking about the gameplay overall: it's awful. The Rhythmic Gymnastics is the exact gameplay as Hatsune Miku Project Diva DX, except with about three songs. The BMX requires rapid mashing of a button and feels like carpal tunnel waiting to happen as opposed to fun BMX racing. None of the touch screen games are close to responsive and are more likely to damage your screen and nerves than be fun. Golf, freaking golf is somehow messed up, thanks to the developers having the bright idea to use the touch screen to play. Soccer, one of the big draws, is awful, thanks to wonky controls and broken AI. There are probably over twenty events on display here. I played them all. None of them are fun. No, really. None. Zip. Zilch. They're all awful, and you'll feel awful if you play them. I mean, the horse-riding one is kind of neat, I guess. Maybe. But... there's like one track. That's it. Same with everything here.

And the sad thing is, there are two versions of each event. The ""real"" version, and the version that's a whacked-out fantasy one. They all basically play the same, though, and not even dumb garbage happening on screen can make any of this ice pick to the skull of a game fun. It's just a non-stop soap enema in game form, no matter which mode you choose. It's a sudsy enema distilled onto a tiny cartridge and foisted upon unsuspecting children. And by the time you realize what you've given those children, it's too late. The bubble bath enema has already been delivered. Mario and Sonic Give Out Soap Enemas. That would have been a better title for this one.

Oh, I guess I should talk about the visuals, but really, why? They just make me upset. A lot of time has been put into some great renders of characters we don't get to see enough of. Like, I really want to see more of Princess Daisy, or Blaze the Cat, or Waluigi. But not like this. I've been wanting the Sonic series to put more of the supporting cast in the games for years, but... not like this. Not in this barren wasteland of a soulless husk of a mini-game enema collection masquerading as children's entertainment. It's like watching Charles Bronson in the last Death Wish movie. You just feel bad. You know they don't want to be there, but the cruel hands of developers manipulate them like puppets, contorting them into sportsball-related poses for the sake of a few quick bucks. They're pimps. Video game pimps. And these visuals? They're basically furry prostitution. You can quote me on that.

Nothing about Mario and Sonic at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games is good. The visuals are depressing. The gameplay is busted. The amount of content feels like a threat as opposed to a selling point. It's just a sad carnival of cringe that makes me think of everyone involved differently. And after I spent a while with it and played another game, I realized that a pixel on my New 3DS, barely three months old, had died.

That means that, no matter what, no matter what I play, no matter how many years pass, this game has left a permanent mark on my life.

Don't let Mario and Sonic at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games ruin your life, too. And don't let it ruin the lives of any children you know. If you see a copy of it, see if you can talk to a sales associate about burning it. Because a heap of melted, molten plastic would be more a contribution to this world than this miserable disaster.

Pros:
- The visuals are okay.
- It's basically functional.

Cons:
- Everything else.

1.0,False,"09 1, 2010",AU4BS4T7B3HHB,B002BSC4ZS,Frederick Heind,"I bought this game with an open mind,knowing that it was going to be different from others in the series. I don't mind that,I don't mind change in a series such as this, I view it as a good thing assuming it is done well. So when I read negative things about this game, I erroneously assumed that it was just die-hard fans of the series that just couldn't accept the change, and that their bias led them to overlook a good game. I was wrong. Very wrong; The game just isn't that good.

The game starts with some very nicely rendered FMV scenes complete with voice acting (barring comparatively minor sound bites, this is the first Nintendo game to feature voice acting, meaning it has an actual script) however the voice acting is average at best in the game,bordering on horrible for certain characters.

Without spoiling too much, Samus answers a distress signal from a space station, and while there happens upon her old buddies from her squad in the galactic federation, including her former commander. These are terrible characters with no personality,as well as being so unbelievably generic as to be indistinguishable form one another, except of course the black guy and the asian guy, who are so stereotypical it's laughable.

In past Metroid games,as you explored the world(s),you would find along the way,various upgrades,namely new beams for Samus' arm-cannon,grappling hook,as well as upgrades to her suit itself. This was a staple of the games as well as the characteristic music that would play when you found those items.

That's where this game falls apart completely. This game throws away that classic colleciton aspect, in favor of a premise so outrageously stupid and contrived that it completely spoils the game and casts a veil of absurdity over the whole thing. It is This:As you arrive on the spaceship,and meet up with your old gang,it is made apparent through a cut scene that the commander has authority over Samus,who has all her abilities available to her, but she agrees to only use them as he authorizes them,and accordingly they are dispensed every so often as their immediate need arises. This is is just a horrible idea that is executed even worse. Samus is always fighting somehting in this game so why wouldn't she want to be well equipped, and why wouldn't her commander want her to be well equipped?Even more ridiculous yet is you must await authorization of the Varia suit which serves no purpose other than to protect Samus from extreme heat in the lava areas. So she won't turn on a feature to prevent her flesh from melting just because it isn't authorized. Among the game are other examples of that nature. I know it doesn't really effect the gameplay really, but as I said earlier it paints the game in such a ridiculous light that it's very hard for me to get over it.

Onto the controls:In the 3rd person perspective aspects, you hold the Wii remote sideways, which actually works very well, considering you are using a 2 pad to control Samus in 3d. Her movements are very fluid and easy to pull off which is nice. However that is only half the game, the other half is first person. At any given time when you flip the controller and point it at the screen, it shifts into a first person view from Samus' perspective. You can aim up and down and 360 degrees but you can't move around, as if her feet were cememented to the spot. This actually works well alot of the time, allowing for a unique novelty. Unfortunately there are other times where the action is just way too frenzied and there are too many enemies around for this to be practical and I found myself taking damage during the switch because there just wasn't enough time to aim and fire. Also for some ridiculous reason you can only use missles in first person.

There are some  very annoying segments that bothered me alot; one of them is when you finish a cutscene, you will sometimes be locked into first person mode, and you can't move until you find a particular object and scan it, sometimes it is so particular it is almost impossible to find.

Another is that occasionally there are some 3rd person segments which do not control like the rest of the game; the camera zooms up behind Samus, and her speed is reduced to a crawl; she may not jump or shoot even. Just walk around. These segments are wholly unnecessary and why the developers included them at all is a mystery to me.

The sad thing is that those problems aside, the game is great. It's very fast paced and the action is excellent, and the graphics, while certainly not the best, can be very vivid and pleasant to look at, with some very pretty areas. The music is somewhat bland I guess but it never becomes annoying. The tragedy is that had the things I complained about been removed, as well as with perhaps scrapping the first person view altogether, this would have been a really great game, but with them, it's basically unplayable.","Would have been a good game, but several horrible design choices render this title unplayable.",1283299200,32,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'm a big Zelda fan and loved all the GBC, N64, GBA and GameCube games, but because of my age, I had never played the ""classic"" Zelda games. So I picked this up, aiming to be a full-blown Zelda aficionado.

Yet within a few minutes of play, I realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of Link's Awakening DX and Ocarina of Time. There are no NPCs to talk to, no exploration to be done, none of anything that I had come to expect from the series. I am well aware that I was probably expecting too much, but whether that's true or not, I was disappointed.

Although I didn't find anything to enjoy in this game, I'm not saying that it's bad. I'm sure that it was a classic of its era, and those who grew up with NES games will probably fall in love with it all over again. But from the perspective of someone who relies only on what she has read and heard for info on this bygone time, it simply seems like a bland, watered-down hack 'n slasher.","Er, sorry to be the ""dissenter"" here...",1115596800,7,,

I have been a fan of The Sims since they first came out with ""The Sims"" and ""The Sims 2"" And I would expect that with such a money making franchise as The Sims, that EA would NOT do what they have been doing... But they did...

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! It will destroy anything you have done in The Sims 3 so far and is buggy beyond belief!

If you want to know how I truly feel... Then think about a time you got that feeling in the pit of your stomach, that made you feel sick because you had just been blatantly ripped off or betrayed... That's how I feel!

It is not a VACATION expansion... It is an ADVENTURES ""add on"" taking a fun non-linear game and making it into a console game where you actually have to go from point a to point b.

It is just downright inhuman what EA does with employees, and how it impacts the finished product.

They constantly lay off hard workers because they are afraid that if anyone works on a game for too long that they may try to leave and start their own company... So EA moves development teams in 6 week to 6 month shifts... Rotating them from project to project... This means that every time they ""rotate"" the new team has to somehow pick up where the old team left off, relearning and trying to figure out what was going on before the ""rotation""... And this creates MAJOR ISSUES. EA also rushes things to release dates even against the development teams wishes to hold off release so they can make a more polished product... EA does not care! They are all about the almighty bottom dollar! So what you get is a half finished, problem causing game, that otherwise would have been wonderful.

Now, onto the MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!! Not only do you pay for this overpriced, half finished game.... But you will also have to pay to ""unlock"" items and features that were otherwise already in the game, but hidden, because selling millions of The Sims 3 wasn't enough for EA, they now want to charge you $20 a pop of REAL WORLD MONEY to get 1000 ""SIM POINTS"" so you can have the matched sets and items and features that should have been in the game in the first place. You can see forum postings and reviews about the REAL COST of The Sims 3 here on amazon.com

This is the FIRST expansion... If you can even call it that, as I see it more as a step backwards. All The Sims games have had expansions that do, in fact, make the base game better and better... Like adding PETS, and a NIGHTLIFE, and actual SEASONS with rain and snow and so on and so forth... The base games also had a great deal of content to begin with, from tons of matched furniture to pools with slides and diving boards, hot tubs, and musical items that you could make your own Sim garage band with... Then enter the Sims 3 with NONE OF THAT STUFF!!!

Then enter The Sims 3 World Adventures, Still not adding anything other than a ONE TIME adventure for your chosen Sims... Yes ONE TIME! Still no vacation... Still no hot tubs... Still no diving boards... Still no pets... No seasons. I can say it was quite fun playing through the new expansion with one of my Sims... But here is one of the many problems... My old towns and Sims have been destroyed with the addition of this expansion... Where my huge town with tons of custom houses and Sims once stood are now blue property sized holes. If that wasn't bad enough... I create a new town and a new Sim household to go on ADVENTURES... I am having some fun exploring and collecting goodies, and enjoying the new themes and whatnot... Until I get bored and decide to try ADVENTURES with a different Sim... This part makes me very angry... Well more angry after losing my Sim town... I CANNOT DO ADVENTURES AGAIN! Yes that is right! Once you go through the tombs and discover everything with one Sim, any other Sims you try to do it with will not get the same bonuses and benefits as the first one! All the paths remain open and revealed, all the doors stay open, all the traps found and disabled, all the ONE TIME ITEMS do not return, including a required item called ""Pengu's Axe""... On top of this is a disappearing inventory glitch where every now and then, items in your Sims ""backpack"" up and delete themselves!

Also, get used to seeing ""Error Code 13"" and ""Error Code 16"" when trying to save your games... When this happens, the save game is corrupted and everything you have done has just been destroyed, and you now have to go into the game save directory and HOPE that there is still a working backup copy you can restore with some less that user friendly editing.

I could go on and on about other glitches and bugs, and the fact they have Day One micro transactions on or before the release date of this expansion showing that they are intentionally leaving things out of the game just to make more cash off the people dumb enough to pony forth said cash.

So that means that only ONE SIM HOUSEHOLD and one Sim household ONLY can get the full experience of the adventures... Any others after that just walk through the already explored tombs with nothing to do and nothing that would be considered an actual ""Adventure."" So unless you want to constantly create whole new towns and start over again just to reset the Adventures... I say leave this game off your holiday gift list... At least until EA pulls their heads out of their donkeys and fixes the glaring issues with this game.

I am 27 years old, I build high end gaming computers, and I have only had to call tech support 7 times in my life... Once 10 years ago for Windows ME, and six times in the last six months! Each of those six times for separate EA games that either didn't work because of something in the game itself, or that relies on some sort of stable connection with ea servers, or was so flawed and buggy that it annoyed me to the point I actually broke down and called them.

As a video game fan, I would rather wait a longer time and PAY MORE for a better, fully polished and finished product, than to have some half done turd that needs a year worth of patches and editing to make even barely playable.

I cannot play The Sims 3 anymore because of this expansion and it's massive glitches and errors, and I am having serious thoughts about Buying ANYTHING from EA ever again!",And now the Sims franchise falls to EAs iron fist!,1259712000,219,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'},

Bandai Namco, in a Square-Enix fashion, managed to shred good memories into pieces by changing the battle formula, the main characters, creating time wasting dungeon puzzles and ridiculously hard random enemies.

About the story, it is 2 years after the dawn of the new world after the party in the original game regenerated and reunited the two worlds. However, in good old RPG manner, there were disputes and discrimination in the new world (which they dealt with already with the Desians in the old game) that the world is far from being united. To even make things worst, the original hero Lloyd Irving seemed to have become the biggest villain in this game. When you were thinking ""What the?"" the game introduced the two most annoying main characters in Tales history - Emil and Marta. Emil basically sulk throughout the game and acted like an idiotic coward. Every time he opens his mouth, you just want to fast forward the cut scenes. As for Marta, although she was supposed to have a greater mission, all the things she said in the game seemed to just want to get laid with Emil. It is extremely frustrating when you need to listen to those conversation again and again after each battle without an option to switch of the dialogues at all. Seriously if Bandai Namco wants to pay homage to the original game, might as well just make a sequel with the same cast tell about their after stories. The two main characters are so unlikable that you just couldn't really be bothered to find out what happened to them.

Adding to that was a completely unrewarding battle and party system. The battle system stayed true but now the party only consists of the two main characters with a Pokemon style recruitment system. The thing is if they actually follow the Pokemon or even the Persona formula, it will be a great system. But then it didn't. Monsters fight with you in real time and evolve, but the AI and strategy controls are so limited you basically have no control over them. Unison attacks all look similar with limited variation so you don't really know whether it is a new move until you look at the name of that move. When monster evolved they reduced back to level 1 and lose their skills (which they can acquire later when they level up again). Now cooking became a means to evolve them and increase their stats but then if you already have leveled up monsters it might be best to stay put and just increase their stats instead of evolving them. So eventually it lost the whole purpose of recruiting new monsters because they all join you at level 1 and required substantial ""wait-in-line level up"" before you can deploy them into battles.

Dungeons in Tales of Symphonia are ingenious and yet challenging. In Dawn of the New World, they are just mere existence for extending gameplay without much value adding to the game. You are repeating all the block pushing and button pressing and that's all. So they make it a lot in each dungeon so you can enjoy listening to the same sound effects again and again for two to three hours. Not because they are difficult to solve but they are so large scale that you just need to run around doing similar things again and again. And to make this even more ""challenging"" they have random enemies that can kill all your party in two or three hits. In one of the dungeons, you need to pick up one of the key cards in one of the rooms, but then suddenly they have random enemies that can cause around 700 damage each hit at a point of the game that 3 hits you'll be dead. To make things worse, Bandai Namco took away the easy on the fly character switching system and replaced it with a complicated and user-unfriendly nun-chuck and Wiimote system that you need a PhD to master it freely. So while you are busily trying to heal and revive your characters, you lost control of all your characters instead.

Dawn of the New World has such potential to be a RPG that Wii owners who love the previous Cube game can embrace it whole-heartedly. But changes to the game just make it a very forgettable game that if you are fans of the old game should strictly stay away. Even the cameo appearance of the original cast won't be able to save it cause the game is overrun by level 99 annoying main characters, cheesy dialogue and exhaustive and uninteresting gameplay.","If you can't make a better sequel, don't!",1262304000,11,,

1.0,False,"02 11, 2010",A250AXLRBVYKB4,B0016BVYAM,ConsumerAdvocate (dakotad555) at (gmail) dot (com),"This review is intended to help educate potential buyers of Bioshock 2 about a few of the major downsides of the way 2K has decided to sell the game. If you've already made up your mind to buy it, or already own it, this review isn't for you. If on the other hand you're on the fence, I'd love to point out a few things that are very troubling about Bioshock 2:

1) The game REQUIRES online activation. If you are a serviceman/servicewoman stationed in Baghdad (or anywhere in the field without internet) you're totally screwed. Requiring an internet connection to activate is offensive in itself, but coupled with the other major issues with this game's DRM scheme, it just keeps getting worse.

2) The game limits the number of times you can install it. I don't care if they give me 1,000 installs, any limit on how long I can use a game I paid for simply isn't acceptable. I'm not paying for the 'privilege' of installing how ever many times 2K or anyone else thinks is appropriate. If I buy a game, I want to actually BUY it, meaning I OWN IT and CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT. If I buy the game and don't like it, how can I resell it? How can I verify to the person I'm selling it to that it has installations left? This is just a petty and insulting way to treat paying customers. I don't want to have to come crawling back to 2K or Microsoft to explain why I might need more installations for a game I already gave them forty or more dollar for. And what if they close their doors at some point in the future? How can I be guaranteed I'll still have access to my game?

3) Securom, the DRM package used by Bioware, installs with the game and there is no option to install it without Securom. That means you get a program running in the background when you play the game that can create issues for other programs on your computer. Don't believe me? I experienced all sorts of issues with the Securom that installed with Mass Effect I including it screwing up my drivers for my optical drives because it didn't like the fact that I has DeamonTools on my computer. I don't want crapware or potential security threats loading on my computer alongside the game!

4) You MUST create a WindowsLive account if you want to access certain parts of the game. I hate WindowsLive and everything to do with it and don't want to create accounts to play my game. I want to install it, run the game, and be on my merry way. Forcing creation of an account is what marketers call ""forced opt-in"" and it opens you up to all sorts of information mining so that Microsoft or whoever collects the data can sell it to marketing companies. Forced opt-ins just flat out suck and I hate when companies force you to jump through their hoops to play their game.

SO WHY DOES THE GAME COME LOADED UP WITH THIS NONSENSE????

2K would say its to fight piracy. I say bull-****. DRM doesn't affect pirates as they're already downloading the widely available and free versions of this (and any other game) from torrent sites. To the inevitable idiots who will spam the comments of this review accusing me of being either a pirate or too poor to buy the game: 1) I own literally hundreds of games and paid for every single one of theme and 2) if I was a pirate I'd already be playing the game from a torrent site without any of the limitations of DRM. Bottom line: if you want to pirate the game, it's pretty amazingly easy. I don't pirate because I'm honest, but neither do I give my money to game makers who like to insult my intelligence by telling me DRM is 'necessary' or that force me to install crapware on my computer.

Thanks but no thanks. I'll take a pass on this one.

**********UPDATE 02/17/2010**********

I had the opportunity to play Bioshock II on my friend's Xbox. Frankly I wasn't impressed with the game itself. It's very much a copy of the original game with very little that is new. I thought the game would center around being an all powerful Big Daddy. You do play as a Big Daddy, but you're not any stronger than the human character starting out in Bioshock I. I expected them to let you be more powerful but also introduce more powerful / numerous opponents. Instead, the same collection of splicers come in twos and threes just like the original game. So as a Big Daddy, it takes 2-3 melee hits (with a huge-*** drill bit mind you) to kill a splicer. It takes them 4-5 melee hits to kill you. That's just simply stupid considering when you fight another Big Daddy it takes a HUGE amount of firepower to bring one down. The whole concept of being a Big Daddy is diminished because you really are not any more powerful.

It's like they took EVERYTHING from the first game, just tweaked it a bit, and called it a new game. There is nothing new that feels significant. The weapons are not exciting, and some of them feel almost useless (the shotgun for one). Only the spear gun and rivet gun have a satisfying quality to them.

You still have the same simplistic moral choice (harvest or rescue Little Sisters), the same voice over the radio guiding you, and the same antagonistic voice prodding you along as you progress through the game. You get plasmids in the same order (electricity, then fire, then ice) and use them to solve the same problems as before (opening doors with electricity, melting snow with fire, etc...). Really it feels like they just redid the first game with less compelling characters and a less compelling storyline.

I'm actually VERY glad I didn't buy this game, even if it were DRM free because it isn't that interesting. It's a rehash of the first and doesn't have anything really remarkable to distinguish it. Honestly, I've played MODS that were free that provided a better gaming experience than this. A good example would be the BT MOD for Oblivion which made Oblivion feel like an entirely new game. For the price 2k is asking (full retail for a new game!) it's just ridiculous.

There are much better options out there. Go get Mass Effect II if you don't have it yet, or even Call of Pripyat from the venerable STALKER series. Both are a lot better than this.

Final thoughts:

It doesn't bother me if you want to buy this game and install it. I just want you to have all the facts before you do. If you don't agree with my perspective that's fine--this is a free country (assuming you live in the USA). Bottom line: some people do care about protecting consumer rights and I'm one of those people. Agree or disagree, I think everyone should have the right to information about the product they're buying.

Perloff,"Mortal Kombat Advance was released years ago, but as long as the game remains on the market, people should be warned of the utter disgrace of a title they may one day consider.  If you're reading this because that day has come, heed my words closely: There is no legitimate reason to buy Mortal Kombat Advance.  None.

Midway was once well-known as a failure in making handheld versions of their popular, arcade-quality titles.  Mortal Kombat Advance is one of these.  The game is filled with bugs, making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant, then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up.  If you're still playing the game after a half-hour or so, it's probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels; simply put, it isn't.  The game just wasn't made well enough to offer fair play against CPU, and if that's all you've got for play options, then your experience is going to be the worst possible.

The rest of MKA's elements are a mixed bag.  The graphics are standard for classic Mortal Kombat games, but the animation is subpar, giving it the air a bad SNES port.  The same goes for sound, which is minimal, and music, which is poor if even existent.  There really isn't anything for this game to fall back on; not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay, but it's an embarrassment to hear and see, too.

The only thing this game is even remotely good for is two-player combat.  There are over 20 ""Kombatants,"" giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up.  Not having to deal with the AI is a plus, but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves; consequently, fights are reduced to button-mashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves, which may or may not even work.  This too may ultimately leave you frustrated, especially since the prospect of playing two-player meant TWO copies of this game were purchased; that's simply two too many.

Midway has learned its lesson since releasing Mortal Kombat Advance, releasing far better titles in MK: Deadly Alliance and MK Tournament Edition.

I purchased this game from EBGAMES not Amazon, when it first came out believing from all the hype this game was going to be great based upon the first Far Cry game and video previews shown.  Big mistake!  This game is nothing like the first game.  The first game was fun!  This game is completely frustrating and depressing in every way possible.  This is probably just like the real Africa itself, which leaves you with the feeling like you need to commit suicide.  And believe it or not that is how the game ends you are forced to commit suicide sounds fun doesn't it NOT.  This game was a forced political statement regarding the state of Africa.  One final problem with this game is that you are also forced to sit through 10 minutes of credits after you complete the game and before you get access to your computer.  10 minutes I kid you NOT, then after the computer comes back you can remove the disk and say to yourself that was the worst game I have ever wasted 50 hours of my life on.  Too bad this game had a chance of being a good game, until the player got sick could not fight and died, the player must travel long boring distances and fight his way through respawning check points in every mission, just to get to a mission, every weapon malfunctions at some point, the enemies don't take damage correctly (I had a enemy that was hit with a 50 Cal sniper riffle get up and kill me), the vehicles break and do not take damage properly, your forced to find medicine and take pills during most important firefights and you die 1/2 the time due to it,  your forced to take a break and inject yourself and perform surgery during a firefight and you die 1/2 the time, your forced to save the game after every single fight to preserve your progress.  It is one interruption after another, which makes for one horrible frustrating game and no fun.  Hopefully, the game engine will be used and tweaked by another worth while developer that actually knows how to make a fun game that flows.  Hopefully, that new developer will say no to DRM, so you can actually play the game you purchased!  This game's graphics are really nice and fire effects are awesome, but this game is not worth the frustration.

This game is defective on so many levels.  Two major bugs you can rely on to get your money back are as follows 1) There is a defective mission bug in the game itself that prevents you from rescuing a hostage at the cockfighting area in the game.  You are unable to proceed with the game due to this error (there is a work around but it clearly renders this game defective) and 2) the Sony DRM copy protection software prevented me from running the game on my system half of the time.  I constantly got an error that stated the original disk was not in the drive, when it was in fact in the drive.  It is like gambling in a casino when I went to launch the game to see whether or not the game would actually load correctly or give me the error message and prevent me, a paying customer, from playing the game.

I contacted Sony and EB Games regarding the DRM disk problem which was unable to be resolved.  UBI support is non existent on its website.  Only other players offer any kind of help.  It took EB Games two weeks before an actual human being contacted me by phone.  All of their emails to me for help took the position that EB Games has a no return BS policy on a open product, which is clearly illegal.  EB Games did in fact give me a refund, after speaking in person to the EB Games representative, so chalk one up for EB Games taking responsibility for its defective games.  If any retailer refuses to give you a refund for this defective game just dispute the charge on your credit card.  This works every time even in light of the no refunds on open products policy most retailers have.  If it does not work seek legal help.  So be persistent and you can force these giant companies to compensate you for their unfinished horrible DRM invested products they sell and force on you. Whether this will change their conduct to create a better product is yet to be seen.  But this will take profits away from these companies and force them to obey the law in the United States!

If consumers make these companies refund enough sales you can make them change their horrible policies of treating every customer as a criminal.  And by the way EB Games didn't even want their game back lol, probably because the DRM prevents any type of resale lol (they screw themselves also)!

This is a great way to get your money back without incurring attorney fees, learn it, use it!  I hope some of you disappointed with this game use this method to get your money back.

This game and any other games using SONY DRM should be removed from Amazon and all other retail stores due to their defective nature! These games with SONY DRM are all ""non-conforming goods"" under the Uniform Commercial Code, and you can get a refund based on these defects in all 50 States, in the USA!

Loot is rare, I mean scarcely rare, and so randomized you could play, like me, hundreds of hours and get nothing good for your character. BUT, you can take all your gold and try to find an over priced upgrade on the Auction House, a place where you will compete with hundreds of auction house farmers that sit lurking for reasonably listed items they can buy instantly to relist for a 100x markup... Oh, you could do this too of course, if you don't mind drudging through a spreadsheet seeking items to buy and resell... Sound like fun? Of course, while doing this you won't actually be playing the game... or leveling your character... or progressing. If you buy D3 know you will be buying a 60 dollar auction house run by a bunch of mean spirited monsters preventing you from affording even a single upgrade... They even have a nickname for their little style of play, Diablo Tycoon.

However, the first play through is good. You might buy it and, like me, think it's a great game. Play 400 hours and see if you feel the same way!

I heard someone call this game PvAH, that's, Player vs. Auction House, and let me tell you, that's all this game is, A giant Auction House. And as a player you will be forced to use the auction house if you want to progress, because loot you can use is about as common as finding hundred dollar bills laying on the ground.

Lastly, the game shipped with exploits and dupes and gosh knows how many economy breaking bugs... The company is more focused on nerfing characters abilities and spots in the game that are player friendly than doing anything for characters who are struggling...

1.0,False,"07 3, 2008",A3ESEJUNUQZU2I,B0013G0XZC,P R,"As a fan of playing tennis, I was very eager to try Top Spin 3. Since I use my Wii for exercise as well as entertainment, I like to play sports games -- especially tennis ones -- to get some activity. However, although I was initially looking forward very eagerly to Top Spin 3, I found that its execution was seriously lacking.

For one, there are only a handful of players even available, some of which aren't really all that intuitive to guess. I'm not a follower of professional tennis very closely, but even I could see that there are some glaring omissions. Also, there is no character creation, so the individual element is completely absent. They added a few original characters, but they somehow felt that they could not even include a rudimentary character creation mode? Sloppy.

What is most sloppy, however, and utterly disappointing is the game itself. No difficulty settings means that the unforgiving and often very bad control scheme has to be accustomed to on the fly. A pathetically inadequate tutorial does not excuse this fundamental omission. Furthermore, the controls themselves are as far from intuitive as possible; the controller is, for some reason, held sideways. The player's character moves on-screen in a stuttering mess that frequently prevents him from reaching an adequate point from which he may return the ball. The controls, which are supposed to mimic the player's own movements, rarely do this and are token at best. Typically you will try for a special shot exactly as the tutorial instructed, only to have it ignore your movements or misinterpret them.

That doesn't even begin to address the other fundamental problems it has, such as the fact that it doesn't feel like you actually control anything. Even the pop-up help instructs you to time your swings to match the on-screen player. Why, then, are we instructed to swing at all, if the game itself tries to anticipate our swing and then make us match theirs?

I thought that Top Spin 3 would surely be more satisfying than Sega Superstars Tennis which, while a pretty good game, lacked in tournaments and was too harsh when it came to unlockables through them. There also wasn't that much responsiveness depending on specific motions by the player, which Top Spin 3 was supposed to address. Unfortunately, however, it didn't. Sega Superstars Tennis remains a vastly superior game, both in entertainment value and tennis authenticity, even with the super moves.

To boot, Sega Superstars Tennis also had three control schemes, which Top Spin 3 would have benefited from; the movement in Top Spin 3 is atrocious and unresponsive at the worst times. Having an option to handle it automatically would have been a great relief. However, they opted for the extremely awkward option of holding the Wii remote sideways, for no valid reason.

All in all, Top Spin 3 plays like an unfinished tech demo that should never have left the studio. It's a poor excuse for a tennis game, but moreover it's a poor excuse for a game overall. With horrible music, barely adequate sound effects (and an absolutely gratingly annoying umpire/judge voice that belches out his calls), and mediocre graphics, it looks like an unfinished PS2 game that they thought they could slap a full asking price on and sell.

This game isn't even worth bargain bin trips. Give it a miss and buy Sega Superstars Tennis instead, or wait for a more satisfying realistic tennis game. Top Spin 3 isn't it. In fact, it isn't much of anything at all.","A Shoddy Tech Demo, but Full-Priced",1215043200,7,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

My main complaint is the graphics -- they are still using MW 1 and MW 2 quality graphics. Compared to GoW 3, Battlefield 3, Rage, etc., etc., (and even older games like Crysis 2), MW3 sucks by comparison. Not even close. It's like the difference between an HD football game and a 360p football game -- it's really, really noticeable. I should note that the single player graphics are better than the multiplayer textures, however, which is the opposite of Battlefield 3.

They did add in some new game modes and stuff that are nice, and the single player campaign is still quite fun (even with the sub-par graphics), but I can't believe this game is projected to sell 17 million copies in the first week. This game will do well, but eventually their momentum will slow with this kind of sub-par performance. It's like they aren't even trying because they don't have to. Think: IBM in the 80s. It can, and will fizzle unless they get their act together -- Activision's Call of Duty is NOT too big to fail.

Multiplayer is different from Battlefield 3, which emphasizes massive, well, battlefields, with lots of heavy tanks stuff. Fairly different gaming experience. The two are not directly comparable. But if you like the up and close combat of Modern Warfare I think Gears of War 3 is vastly superior.

Bottom line: spend your money on Battlefield 3 or Gears of War 3 -- game franchises that are still innovating. They offer a somewhat different experience, but it is a much better experience. I would buy this for $30, but not $60. By the time you add in DLC like map packs and stuff, much less the Elite service, they are asking $100+ for it. A remarkable act of hubris, and as another reviewer said, rather insulting. If the price was more reasonable I would rate the game higher.

Well, Bleszinski, I decided to purchase Gears 3 anyway (in hopes that you had a second thought and listened to my feedback), and the problem of me not being able to kill with the lancer still remains.

I can easily kill with it in single player and horde mode, because the AI plays fair and allows me to shoot them. They don't run away and camp and snipe me and shotgun me like everyone does in multi-player. It's funny when there are cutscenes with gear soldiers killing with the lancer, as if that's possible in the game.

Until the Lancer is buffed, I will not play Gears of War 3. In fact, Gears of War? More like, TEARS OF WAR. I am GLAD that this is the last game in the series.

Initially I thought I was going to love it because of the cool graphics.

Unfortunately, they made it too hard.  One of those British idiots decided to only allot you 4 lives per section. But some of the sections are infuriatingly difficult, so when you fail them, you have to go back to the entire beginning of the level.  Why couldn't they have just given you infinite lives?  That way, the game would have been fun to explore and savor.  As it is, you don't want to bother collecting anything (e.g., the stickers) because there's no guarantee you'll survive the level, and if you don't, all your work will have been for nothing.

And when you are bounced back to the beginning of the level, you won't think the graphics are so fun anymore.  In fact, this entire game has overtones of punishment.  The sad part is, this could have been easily fixed:  they could have either:

1. given you infinite lives;
2. given you infinite jump ability;
3. made it so that your character can grab on to ledges and pull himself up;
4. or at least allowed you to save and load from your last checkpoint, so that you can practice only the part you're not getting.
5. allowed to you pay your unused lives forward;
6. or at least had different difficulty settings

or something.

But making you go all the way back to the beginning of each level was pure viciousness.  It's just torture with a cutesy face!  I'd like to meet the gamer who is agile enough to make it through the ""Wheel of Death"" in the ""Bunker"" level, yet who is excited about earning a ""flower print dress"" at the end.

I don't mind games being difficult.  Lord knows I've made it through some pretty hard video games.  What I do mind is all your work being incinerated and not counting for anything and having to do it all over again.  Again and again.

I suspect the reason Media Molecule set it up this way is that if they hadn't, you'd be able to finish this game in about 3 hours, so little content is there.  But making it so that if you die 4 times in any one section you have to repeat the entire level, this was a way, I suspect, of making the game last at least 2 or 3 days.

And most of the time you die, it's not even your fault.  See, this game isn't 2D.  It's not 3D.  It's somewhere in the middle (I believe programmers call this ""2.5D"").  It looks like a 2D platformer, but there are actually three lanes you can be in:  the foreground, the middleground, and the background.  The problem is that, not only is it hard to tell what lane you're in in any given moment (you're not allowed to pan the camera about), but the game thinks nothing of bouncing you back and forth between these lanes without your having requested this, such as when you bump in to a wall or when you land from a jump.  So you'll keep dying on a lot of the jumping challenges because you can't make out where on the Z axis your character is exactly, or which lane your target spot is in.

When I first saw this in the store and fired it up, I thought it was some sort of science game.  The kind where kids would play a cute character and learn about gravity, friction, temperature, whatever.  Actually, it's the complete opposite of a science game:  it teaches kids not to explore . . . exploring is not worth the risk, because likely you'll wind up getting electrocuted and have to start the stupid maze all over from the beginning.

And here's the final insult:  the game claims that it saves your data ""automatically,"" except that it doesn't, or at least it doesn't do it predictably.  I had serious problems with this.

The day I finished this game, I had played it for about 12 hours straight:  straight from, I think, the Serpent Shrine all the way up to the Collector, whom I finally defeated at about 3:00 in the morning.  My games were not saved, even though I went back to the ""Pod"" several times during the course of the day.  After finally defeating the final boss, my save game only showed that I had made it up to the ""Endurance Dojo.""  Why did it save up to that point but no further?

This was definitely not on account of my having shut my PS3 off at the wrong moment:  having experienced this before and having assumed it was owing to some fault of mine, I, after finishing, took great pains to exit using the circle button to get all the way back to your spaceship where it says ""Use Pod Computer"" so that it would definitely save the fact that I had finished the game.

But even that wasn't enough to get it to save my game.  There's no way to force a manual save, either.  In short, the creators of this game owe me a completed game file, because I'm sure as heck not going to go through those levels again!  And I need hardly mention that the wankers at Media Molecule won't permit you to use another user's savedata file.  (I currently believe you have to exit to the PS3 and choose ""Quit Game"" for your data to be saved . . . still not sure, though.)

Truly the worst game I know of for the Playstation 3.  I didn't have a minute of fun with it.  I regret every moment I spent with it.  I thought I was going to be treated to all sorts of eye candy but was just in a rage the entire time I was playing it.  My poor wife.

Lesson learned:  avoid all titles by Media Molecule, or titles for which you can discern that Mark Healey or Alex Evans had a hand in making.  They make games evil on purpose and then market them as though they're for kids.

Honestly, it's the most gorgeous game I've ever seen to date. At the same time, probably the least fun to play of all of the games I've owned in years, which I can't even believe I'm saying.

As a game, I would have rather played Battlefront 2 for the PS2 - which I still own and just played a moment ago to see if I was crazy.  Turns out I'm not crazy, and neither are the many people who have written these negative reviews on the game.  There was so much hype and so many people who hoped for the best (like me) or prepared for the worst (unlike me)...  I am so disappointed. After 24 hours, I feel crushed and broken, and I feel like my money has been wasted.

As for the actual review, I will say that other than the ""Walker Assault"" mode, the rest of the game play seems to be a bore to me.  I had a lot of fun with the beta and thought there would be much, much more. OK, there are a few more maps and modes to play with, but as a solo guy with no roommates or family, and not really a strong community of PSN friends to join for these online game modes, it's just not the game for me. And before I get scolded for saying that, it is my fault because I knew it would be more online based.  I just assumed the game developers were being ""hush hush"" about any campaign modes that might be there.  I gambled and lost. My mistake.

The guns are fine. I don't mind them the way others do.  Being a Hero/Villain is fun.  But after an hour, I just want to go play another game.  Flying vehicles are cool....  but...  Why do I have to die to get out of a Tie Fighter/X-Wing, etc.?  Why can't we go to space? WHAT IS STAR WARS WITHOUT SPACE???  And don't tell me it's coming later in a downloadable map. I'll be even more upset if it comes later because that just tells me they could have released a game with space battles from the start, which actually may have made this game 1000x better by itself. (y'all really screwed that up IMO).  What a waste, Dice/EA.

In my opinion, this game is absolutely inferior to Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I would have been happier with a remastered Battlefront 2 for the PS4.

It truly breaks my heart to express such harsh criticism. Although this ""review"" is more of me complaining than actually reviewing the game, the truth of the matter is that there's not a single thing I can say that hasn't already been said here in the other reviews, over and over again.  It truly is a spectacle to see...  and nex-gen graphics with something we all love, in Star Wars.  But horrible for a video game. This would have been better as playable trailer for the new movies.  As a game, It's nothing at all like the teasers or behind-the-scenes videos/documentaries I've watched for the past 2 years. It's not even as good as Battlefront 2, in my opinion.  I'm disappointed and bored with the game after just one day.  If I can't get into the game and enjoy it right away, it's not for me.  But this is Star Wars.  I thought George Lucas was the only person who could screw it up.  Turns out Dice/EA have followed suit, making it an overpriced and underwhelming product.

I plan to take it to a GameStop, or someplace similar, sometime in the next day or so and sell it used and take whatever financial hit it is.

Unbelievable!

From what I hear, maybe if I send the right person at Valve an actual photo of my box, and wait two months, I might be allowed to play.  However, that's certainly not what the text on the Steam support page says.

Plot: as generic as it gets. By the end of the day, you won't remember a single character from this game or what it was about. The concept of ninjas using guns just seems silly anyways. 2/10

Graphics: clunky and blocky, rather poor even for 2002. Textures are EXTREMELY bad and make the game a serious eye-sore. 4/10

Sound: overall it's okay. The music is so monotonous and bland it's barely there. Most of the voice acting is stale and lifeless. 4/10

Gameplay: You just blast away and reload when needed. That's really the only strategy in this game. Being completely exposed to attack forces the player to always kill enemies quickly. The only time you'll have to catch your breath is when the next level is loading. It doesn't feel satisfying to finish a level or beat a boss, you'll just be wondering how much longer it is until the game is over. 3/10

Now thats ok for real life  but this is a video game and you can not simulate real life events because you will screw the game it is like playing not only against the opponent but against the inpossible. to score a corner kick forget it. oh i forgot if you shoot from a senseless area you  have 95% chance to score lol. what a POS,the only good thing about this game is the good graphics,1411516800,2,,

You all know about the series, so I'll forego the plot summary. A lot of people have played apologist for this series, answering the valid complaint of, ""Why are ALL the games the same?"" with a variety of sophistries, but the fact is, this game has little invention in it.
I was disappointed in part two because of the ridiculous length of the game (it took me about nine hours). Part three answered this problem, and also had some nice bonuses (such as searching for ghosts of the series characters and finding items for trading), and I was eagerly anticipating part four.
So what's the problem here? Not length; this game may be the longest of the bunch (although, it still only clocked in at about 23 hours; I like a little more meat on my RPG's). The gameplay is the same, but hey, that's what we've come to expect. No, the problem here is story, in that this game has little. Most of the questions you might have asked, most of the theories you might have postulated concerning The World won't be answered here. The end of the game (which, though I thought about it, I will not spoil here) is quite unsatisfactory  (ho-hum is the best word I can use to describe it), and in the end, this whole series (which, if you purchased new, will run you around two hundred bucks) left me feeling like I was cheated out of one hundred and fifty dollars. Yeah, I confess; there is enough material here for one game, maybe one and a half, but Bandai has cheated us out of a lot of money, in my honest opinion.

The Bad:
-The camera is almost never focused on what you need to see. The enemies are off-screen where you can't fight them, and you die because you are blind to them. When you're in the tank with Shadow, you drive off the map and can't find your way around.
-There are glitches. Sometimes when you're running through loops; your character falls through them when they're obviously not supposed to, and you die.
-The load times are frequent. They occur before a cutscene, after a cutscene, before a boss fight, after a boss fight, after you die, before and after you begin the next phase. It slows the action down to boredom within minutes.

The biggest issue is that it's slow even on a nearly new top of the spec machine. And turning down the graphics details, etc., doesn't do all that much to help. The graphics aren't that great anyway, everything is a little fuzzy even on the highest setting.

Then there are a lot of minor, but very annoying, things that didn't get done. Throughout the manual it says to ""roll over"" things to get help. But most of the help system apparently wasn't completed, because there's no rollover help.

It says to press Escape to get out of screens. But it doesn't work on several of them, you have to find the exit button and press it. And the exit button is in a different place on every screen - no consistency at all.

And then there's the web site - I went to try to see if there was any help or patches, but it won't let you in if you don't have Flash. Some of us don't want or can't use Flash - if you don't provide us an alternative, then you're shutting out a lot of people.

First off, as you might have seen elsewhere, you can't press two adjacent buttons down at the same move diagonally. I just verified this on firmware version 1.2, which is the latest as I post this. In my case, I am only using two buttons (up/down). The other two buttons are unassigned. If I press one of the unassigned buttons and then try to also press down one of the other buttons adjacent to it, nothing happens.

From a hardware perspective, it's pretty clear that diagonal usage was an oversight. Transitioning between directions feels clunky.

Secondly, I am having a problem where intermittently, instead of mapping to the keys I have assigned for each directional pedal, the WASD keys are used instead of the keys I have mapped. For example, I have mapped the PAUSE key to what would be S. Occasionally and without warning, S will get depressed and stay down for a period of 3-5 seconds. As you can imagine, this can be infuriating.

Another problem I have is that the unit slides around the carpet. I put some grip tape under the bottom and that has mostly solved the issue for me.

The length of the cable is good.

I wish it was a little more quiet, but I am usually wearing a headset anyway.

The software application works, but it's a little raw. Definitely not done by a professional. Pressing F1 launches the help application, but there is no help file for it.

-Game can be beat in 4 hours
-No end-game at all, once you finish the game for the 4th time in a row there is literally nothing left. Sure you can continue to farm items, but for what? You've beaten all the PvE and there is no PVP
-Loot system is broken
-Developers will nerf items and stats dramatically without any warning whatsoever, making items completely useless (spend 20$ on an awesome sword yesterday only to have it nerfed? too bad, buy a new one)
-Online latency problems
-Dwindling player population (players are leaving in droves, for reasons stated above)

I'll wait a year for the price to come down.  This game is one of the games that I've been waiting to buy.  After reading all the good reviews I was a bit excited at first.  Now that I played a few hours of the game, I think I can give a few comments of the game.

The concept is interesting.  However, the gameplay can be frustrating.  I've never played the first one so I'm not sure if it is relevant to the 2nd Bioshock.

The story itself is intriguing.  The controls of BD make sense.  As I first met with some of the denizens, I realized how difficult the game is.  I think the developers tried to make it real by having Big Daddy to suffer damage easily because of the 50's technology.  For one thing, BD does not have any shield and the health does not regenerate.  A single shot taken by BD can easily take half of BD life.  Two or three shots and I have to start all over from the nearest vita-chamber with the supplies lost.  At some scenes it gets really frustrating - I died at least 10 times before I could get past the stage.  By the time I'm done, I lost all my ammo, fuel and EVE.  Walking around with either is asking for trouble.  At this day and age, I think it is ridiculous to make a game so difficult to play.  I play games to release stress from my daily life.  Games like this really take the fun out of the equation.  While I don't deny there are some good qualities of the game, but making the player really work to get the good qualities is just a little too much.

The game has troubles with support for any hardware with an on-board graphics processor, along with a dedicated GPU (such as an NVIDIA or ATI card).

After searching the web for a long time, I stumbled across a solution that will bypass the error by simply adding a line of code through the ""Launch Settings"" option in Steam.

I loved this game, I've played it for over 224 hours, the game suddenly began crashing every time I played, making the game unplayable.

I haven't even touched the expansions because I wanted to make sure I took my time, what a huge mistake that was.

Anyway, a month or two ago the game started crashing anytime I interacted with a merchant. Now the game crashes after playing for 15-20 minutes or anytime I interact with an NPC. Rendering the game unplayable.

 I've reported the 38+ crashes to PSN and have contacted CD Projekt Red and WB games. After looking online, I found multiple people posting back over a year who have the exact same issue.

CD Projekt Red suggested making sure I had the latest updates (I did), uninstalling and reinstalling (I did, on different HDs even), reverting back to my earliest save (no change). After explaining this, the person I was emailing with suggested deleting my saves and starting over, throwing away 224+ hours of my life because they could care less about fixing a game that everyone's already given them their money for. Complete garbage way of handling this, no understanding or sympathizing with my situation at all.

This is so disappointing for many reasons, the first being that this game is universally beloved by everyone, including me before it broke.

The second reason being I truely believed that CD Projekt Red was different from the other developers, even if WB was publishing it. Then I saw how poorly they were rated by current and past employees on GlassDoor, even worse than EA, shockingly.

If/when the game is fixed & had the customer/tech support had seemed to care or empathize at all, this would be a 5 star game. As of today (10/1/17) this game is zero stars, it did nothing but take up space on my hard drive since it became completely unplayable, so I've deleted it.

Hopefully enough people will speak up when/if this happens to them and CD Projekt Red will be forced to patch/fix their broken game. As of right now, I've never wished PSN gave refunds more..

Players run into the backs of their teammates and fall down and play is blown dead.

Never mind, no point talking about and mentioning how every time you sign in they ask you to take a survey so they can see how bad they messed up but the survey never pulls up and gives you an error message and won't let you take it..

To begin with, this is the first game in the series and it is inferior in every way imaginable to both of the sequels, especially compared to the Dark Side which has TONS more of everything in terms of content, features, units, quests, items and so on. So, if you played either Armored Princess or the Dark Side, you should skip The Legend.

But The Legend's inferiority to the sequels is the least of its problems. The REAL problem is that The Legend still has many bugs - many small ones, but also a couple of HUGE ones:

- Some quests are bugged and cannot be completed (at level 14 I already encountered two such quests);

- Some NPCs which clearly should be interactive are not interactive;

- And then there is the Ice Spirit Lina bug. You rely on your spirits in The Legend as you would rely on your pet dragon in Armored Princess or on Blackie in the Dark Side to prevail in combat, but one of the four of your spirits (Lina) cannot be activated. I uninstalled/reinstalled the game, followed other suggestions I found on the forums where users discuss this exact problem - nothing works for me: When I get to the energy source to recharge Lina, I can click on it, but nothing happens and her dialogue options do not change to where she agrees ""to serve"" me.

Bottom line, even if you never played any of the King's Bounty games, just skip The Legend. It is still half-broken, will never be fixed and it is a waste of time (as you will need at least 150, maybe 200 hours to finish it).

Get Armored Princess or Dark Side or both. Oh, and finally The Legend is very unbalanced in terms of the enemies you encounter - a good number of quests you get at level 3 cannot be completed until level 14+ and STILL you will lose 90% of your army while fighting quest enemies.

What's up with these ""quests"" that consist of ""the beastie stole my stuff and went into this cave"", go into the cave, kill the patheticly easy beastie and ""tadaaa, you completed the quest and got 25,000 experience points"".

Too linear. Even with the expanded maps in the expansion the game still consists of straight line outdoor paths with a few really small dead end caves to break up the monotony. Follow the edge of the map from rebirth fountain to rebirth fountain, kill the small packs of repetitive critters, collect stuff, sell it in town and move on. Endless repetition of areas, tilesets, equipment and critters. If you do encounter a tough beastie, there are a couple, run away, get back to town, restock your healing potions and switch weapons.

New skillset: What does the new skillset have to do with dreams? It's a pretty routine sorcery set, some spell effects with a familiar which has a death ray............Nice graphics but nothing original.

Crafting and recipes: Why can't I pick and choose what items I want to combine into a charm? Why insist on these bizarre combinations to get ""plus 4% to whatever"" and it can only be used on a bow or a shield, etc. Silly, frustrating stuff.

Expanded backpacks, caravan ""stash"", scrolls: Thankfully they added the caravans. But they're not in every town so you need to teleport from town to town carrying junk from the vendor to the arcanist to the stash and back. To assemble a relic colect all the pieces, insert in equipment to assemble, then take it to an arcanist to remove the assembled relic, then collect the various assembled stuff and take it back to the arcanist to complete a charm.........Whoever designed this mess needs to understand that I want to spend most of my time hacking and slashing critters, not jerking around enchanting stuff. Every town should have whatever's needed in proximity to each other, merchant, arcanist, caravan, etc. The scrolls are a great addition but they take way too long to recharge.

What they did right: The skills interface remains excellent, it's clear, organized and easy to use. The graphics are gorgeous despite the glitches.

1.0,True,"10 24, 2013",AP6ZR3DA2IR78,B0050SX7BQ,Stephanus,"I purchased this game because it looked promising,both as a story and as a game. I acquire and play lots of video games (Mac, PC and PS3).  I also watch lots of movies.  I am also a Science Fiction enthusiast.

Beyond Two Souls (BTS) is a mashup of video gaming and movies.  In brief, it is my opinion that this game is not worth anyone's time, nor anyone's money.  While I do not believe there are any spoilers, here, your opinion may differ, and you should take that into consideration before continuing with this review.

Executive summary:
Boring, it is a rehash of many Science Fiction films and Literature.
Boring, it has little, if no, game play.
100% Predictable.

Let's just say for one to have a good Movie, one must have a good Story. There is nothing new about this particular story.  I would like to say that there are spoilers, but there are none.  In every direction this movie took, visions of Carrie, Poltergeist and every Telekinetic SciFi film or story came to mind.  Every action, every move, were 100% predictable.  In some sequences, the action was so familiar, I could not help but feel the Developers literally copied the movements and actions from many popular action movies. Yes, Deja Vu applies here.

Now let's talk about game play.  I think I was too kind to call it lame.  In multiplayer mode, one player is in normal mode, the other is psychic mode.  The psychic mode needs to be transferred every time, say to an iPad.  The controls were so clumsy, I finally gave up and just played solo.  For instance, you have to move the controls such that two icons are brought together to invoke a specific telekinetic action.  If I were telekinetic, from Carrie to any other SciFic film or book, the telekinetic action is an Act of Will, not requiring any specific set of hand motions.  The nose bleeding was clearly something from Firestarter (a film about a young girl who could telekinetically start fires).

At those times you are allowed to control the character, the control generally deals with very mundane actions.  For instance, to cross a river, the character moves by you pushing the L1 and R1 buttons to make her cross the river.

In the final phases of the game, our Protagonist must choose her future life.  There have been several video games that deployed this concept, most notably the early Silent Hills games.  However, in BTS, the end results are barely influenced by your actions through the game, but by your choices with whom you will take up with.  I did not get through all the choices, but I understand there are about 21 endings.

The Developers had some very good assets, motion captured from some very attractive and very talented actors.  However, it is not the first time good talent was misapplied to a cliched story, and as an excuse for poor game design.  A saving grace is that you can get through the game fairly quickly, say about 10 to 12 hours.  However, when I look the games I have played, such as Skyrim, Borderlands, Borderlands 2, even Defiance (as derivative as it is), are more fun, more exciting, more interesting, but I am also comparing games that are not of the same genre: BTS is a linear movie, while the others are open ended sandboxes.

The sad part about this is, should this have been made into a 100% movie, it is so badly cliched, so predictable and boring, it would barely make the $5.00 Direct to Video bin at Fry's.","It's Deja Vue all over again, boring, lame game play",1382572800,18,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

And I gave this at least a few days worth of effort before giving up.  I think one of the biggest annoyances was the lack of variation in enemies.  It seemed to take forever to reach a new type of enemy, and then they'd just be some small variation on everyone I was already fighting.  A little bit faster, a little more health.

I never felt driven by the story.  In fact, now that it's been a year or so, I don't even remember what it was anymore.  But I remember at the time, just not caring that much.  I could possess rats, though...and that's about all that really stood out as cool to me.

Another annoying part for me is that you never speak in the game.  Everyone else does, but you're totally silent, which makes you feel like you're more watching than playing the game.

I never expected it to be so flawed and it kinda left me questioning this whole thing with EA Sports. Once I saw that EA Sports picked up the rights to UFC, I knew it wasn't going to be good. The UFC Undisputed series was phenomenal, each year they were improving.

This game though, it is severely flawed. It also has some glitches that leave you scratching your head as to ""How the hell did that happen?"". For example, I did a takedown with Condit against St. Pierre, I TOOK HIM Down and he was down and suddenly...he popped up back up in 3 seconds and knocked me out! How did he get up when I had him in side control???

The characterizations and details of the fighters are impressive but it is so much better when graphics are not placed as a marketing chip than the actual gameplay. The graphics overshadow the games severity and it isn't a positive thing to take notice in.

The moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had. A lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves. Trust a real person a real gamers  review, I will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it, go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesn't make sense, its very anti-climactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful online.

So when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to, I gave up playing this online as the game isn't good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming. Just to make your gear/outfit/armor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance, such as I'm wearing a cool armor and weapon but I make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on, just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game???

A lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying, I'm sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing, this is what happens when you force people to spend more than 300 hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time. Imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops, you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending 1-2 hours or more in it and the boss doesn't drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon? You catch my point in games like this thats not an MMORPG massively multi-player online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a 100% drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over. A note to the developers this game isn't an MMORPG so don't try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n over.

The game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get, and the game isn't rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armor/weapon. The music in the game is just below average, the storyline super cliche, The graphics are just slightly better than Playstation 2 quality, the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons, but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really I'm going to farm 400 hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics? No thank you. I completed the game and the sequel because I'm one of those hardcore gamers even though I don't like a game if i find something of small interest in it I will continue to play it till i finish it, but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isn't worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay. The problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete. Having to spend months to a year or so on one game... that to me is just super lame.

If you want a decent RPG that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a 400-500+ hours of pointless grinding/farming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank me.

I miss the days of Grandia, Final fantasy 6-7-8-X, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Secret of mana, Star ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile, Zelda 1, 3 and Ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there.

That said, the game itself hasn't really aged well. The mechanics of the classes are derived from the quake days, and the limitations show.

Biggest example is the soldier. Now, the soldier relies heavily on a move called the ""rocket jump"" where you basically fire a rocket at your feet and then use the energy to fly in the air towards your enemy.

Without the rocket jump, the soldier is lousy.

However, the rocket jump is also very hard to get right. It also does damage to you. It relies on what amounts to a bug in the original quake's physics engine.

Other games have done it better. In particular, Firefall (a game that is still in beta) has the assault class which fires rockets just like the soldier. He has a rocket pack. And several movement boosting abilities. It works out quite well. ALso, the jetpack class in warhammer space marine does it better.

No noticeable improvements or features have been added at all, nor any claimed basic features (such as save states) or external additions. This is fine, though.

Pretty much take your favorite feature of Sims (aging, families, downloading hot babes from the EA exchange, find some way to stuff seven Sims and a shrieking baby into a one-bedroom treehouse), and replace it with this mind-numbingly boring ""quest"" system, where ""quest"" means ""The Game Tells You What Selection To Click On So Nevermind This Thinking (or Creativity) Stuff and Thanks For Your Money"". You have fifty ""quest points"" to spend on quests, then you can't do anything more with your kingdom. You do ""unlock"" another kingdom, but it looks EXACTLY THE SAME and you do the SAME QUESTS all over again! I exaggerate a bit, since, in reality ALL THE QUESTS ARE THE SAME, sorta like how choosing Friendly - Chat is strikingly NOT different from Friendly - Ask About Day.

It's called a ""linear quest game"", except my dictionary doesn't define ""linear"" as ""Go click on the yellow quest bubble AGAIN and choose the blatantly mind-numblingly obvious selection AGAIN that sticks out like sore purple gangrenous thumb AGAIN"" but I guess the EA dictionary does, right next to the one that defines customer as ""SUCKER"".

You pretty much do nothing but quests, and the game's quests are a linear ""Lead-You-By-The-Nose-With-A-Meathook-Through-Said-Nose"" walkthrough consisting of more mouse clicking than creativity or thinking as the game tells you the ONLY thing you can do to go to the next ONLY thing you can do to get through the quest. Want to recruit a guard as a volunteer for the army? Well, tough! You have to get the town local drunk and have HIM volunteer. Why? Because the game told you to. That's why. End of discussion. You *can* do some Sims sandbox stuff, but it's downright limited. For example, you can buy furnishings -- not that you want to, since everything comes pre-furnished -- but can't modify the architecture. This game might as well be titled ""Generic Medieval Do-Nothing-But-Click-Where-the-Game-Tells-You-To We-Took-Your-Money-So-HA-HA-HA"" Game. Maybe there will be a good Sims standalone game, but this isn't it. EA, Just release a decent ""Medieval and Magic"" Sims expansion set, take our money, and give us something decent and fun.

So why did I buy it? Because it was 50% off. And, even then, it was a ripoff.

And, maybe, because it had SIMS on it, I was expecting a SIMS game. EA should have called it ""Sonic the Hedgehog in a Sims Skin Runs Around After the Next Gold Quest Popup Circle in a Medieval Kingdom You Play Frickin' Over and Over Again"" because that's a more accurate description. I mean, I had the game on Speed-3 all the time AND after completing one kingdom, the game starts you over in a new kingdom where you have to START BUILDING ALL OVER AGAIN.

I should mention you DON'T have the choice of ignoring the quests, unless you want the ""Not doing Quest"" moodlet, er, modifier. You don't get ""free play"" mode until you spend hours (or what stretched into what felt like hours and hours) of mindless clicking on the quests.

1.0,False,"11 27, 2015",A32HNOBU0OISSU,B00W8FYFBA,James,"I'll write this review with the goal in mind of stating if it's worth a purchase. I believe The Order is not the worst game in the world, but you shouldn't purchase it as it can be rented and beaten so quickly. Battlefront as well is not the worst AAA game on the market, though via the 10 hour EA access rental period which passed, or simply playing it for a few hours will allow you to experience all there is to this game.

Battlefront is a multiplayer only (Can also play against bots in a limited mode + horde mode) shooter in the Star Wars universe. The last three words ""Star Wars universe"" fully explain the entirety of what this game does right:

- Star Wars sounds, makes it feel like Star Wars
- Visuals, seeing Darth Vader on the battle(front), seeing your favorite star wars vehicle walking alongside you on Hoth.
- Bot games where you can practice being a hero, not having to worry so much about racing other places for hero access.

This ends the list of pro's to the game. I will not take away from them though, bot games may not seem like much, but I am very thankful they were added, especially with split-screen functions. The sounds and visuals really are nice and help with immersion, the problem is this game is a fully priced AAA game with an expensive season pass to get all of the content and these pros (visuals, sound, limited bot mode) can be experienced in their entirety very quickly.

What I believe this game misses includes:

- Unbalanced progression system (no basic loadouts like other games such as CoD, higher level allows you to completely outclass others)
- No Campaign
- No multiplayer vehicles, they are controlled by pickups and even vehicles that should allow more than one person do not
- No squads at all (instead you sometimes get a partner that gives you a spawn point and access to one loadout)
- No choice with spawn points. You spawn where the game tells you to, which is often right in the way of blaster fire so you die immediately. I cannot understate this point, if you are a hero or have access to a turret, you can literally spam attack one spot on the map and rack up tons of kills on players spawning there in the way of your fire over, and over and over.
- no classes
- no synergy, without squads and no classes you cannot synergize or use strategy to help your team
- unbalanced game modes. This does not mean A-symmetry is bad, it means on some maps one side has clear advantages. Also, scoreboard shows K/D on modes where rebels are literally throwing their bodies at objectives in order to win, which discourages them from trying
- All powerups are random pickups on the map (I actually don't mind this, but many do)
- Flight controls, they are much, much better on console. So this being the PS4 version you dodge a bullet. Though, flight spawns, using them for ground combat on objectives, map sizes are all clunky. If you can learn the maps limits and get into the air first, you can dominate it all game by spawn camping and ignoring ground objectives. (also you just auto aim entirely in the air)
- Limited weapons
- very limited powerups, with some being much more powerful than others
- limited variety in maps, even on different maps the game play is identical without any utilization of the environment
- massive grenade spam, this plus the spawn camping means one side will often just die after spawning over and over to unlimited grenade spam

This game is the best example recently of a AAA game made on an assembly line. It's shallow, very little content with no depth to the gameplay. They put in some good Star Wars sounds, added some good visuals and left out gameplay and content entirely. They put no thought into spawns, they put zero team work features, maps are lazily thrown in without any utilization of the environment, they throw an expensive season pass in on the end so maybe we'll get actual content in the future. Video game by committee.

In the end this is not Battlefront, this is a move tie in game with not much to do with Battlefront I or II. It has the quality of a movie tie in game. You will not be mad when you get killed, because through grenade spam, unbalanced maps and teams and random power ups its random. You will not feel good when killing someone for the same reasons. If you want a Star Wars experience and thinks this looks good, rent it. You can get that feeling of awe of being immersed in a Star Wars battle, and after that wears off return it.  There really is nothing this game is trying to do, there is no artistic focus, no interesting features, just pretty lights.

For anybody who has played the original Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSONE loved it (seriously loved it) I implore you, do not buy this game! Of all the negative reviews out there bashing the games flaws(the lag on spells, the useless new job classess, etc.) nobody is saying what REALLY needs to be said. And that is as follows...

Squenix ruined this game when they increased the amount of JP necessary to gain skills and go up joblevels.

For anybody who played the original we all known how hard the game could be and how very necessary it was to spend a good portion of your time developing and training your characters. The game can be quite time consuming in this one aspect, albeit, but it was quite fun and very satisfying (not a word I use often) to see the pay off in characters that could dish out the damage and hold their own in tough situations. Your own A-team, so to speak. The demand for more JP utterly KILLS! this experience.

Take for instance the Lancer's jump abilities. The level 8 jumps only required 900JP to master. Now they require 1500! and thats just one example. In Final Fantasy Tactics, the higher a characters job level the more JP they could aquire. Simultaneously increasing JP required for leveling a character's job level AND gaining skills makes it even more time consuming. It increases exponetially the amount of time needed to level your characters. If feels like you're getting corn-holed from both ends. You can't gain as much JP AND more JP are required to gain skills. AGGH!

For instance, I always like to get Ramza the Ninja's two-swords ability before his one on one duel with Gafgarion. In this way he can use sword break two times in one turn and turn Gafgarion's game completely on it's head. With the PSP version of the game, however, it probably would have taken far too much time to develop Ramza that far. I sold the game after I beat chapter one after realizing getting to this point would require hours, and hours of training while my eyeballs slowly fell out of my skull after staring down at that tiny little screen for so long. Wander around, enter a battle, ingnore the monsters and start doing all the thing us veterans do to gain JP like the Squire's Accumulate, only however much time you spend leveling your characters in the PSONE version, times that by 2.5 and you have a rough estimate of how much you'll playing (and feeling like a nerd with no life!)

I am terribly dissapointed with this game! There is Oh, so much Square enix (or Squenix) could have done to make this better! Giving access to jobs only the bosses had, such as Arc Knight, Sorcorer, Assassin, and many others. Elmdor's Teleport 2 ability, better weapons, better jobs, more missions...

Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to ""user-level"" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game.
Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Warcraft III is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation.

The first ""re-release"" came about about the time of Episode 3.  About 6 months later, the game was re-released as the ""NGE"" i.e. ""New Game Experience"".  After upsetting its player base to the point of a mass exodus to other games such as World of Warcraft, EvE Online, and others - SOE redesigned the game *AGAIN* and has re-released it in this ""Complete Adventures"" set.  About six months ago it was the ""Starter Kit"".  And in about another month it will be released *AGAIN* as part of the  ""Best of Star Wars"" gift set.

This game is in perpetual Alpha/Beta state depending on how much code they delete between patches.  It is not fun at all anymore.  I made a lot of friends through the original SWG - but they have been milking the Star Wars license for all its worth to comedic dramatic effect - culminating in embarrassing gaffes on the Game Channel ""Attack of the Show"" as well as CBS Specials detailing some of the atrocities committed by SOE - and also written articles and a ""mailbag"" special.

So why is it so bad? Well there is an unbelievable amount of hit detection issues. The kinds where you'll pump a guy point blank with 20 rounds (literally an entire clip in some instances)  and you can see blood splatter...but no hit markers, and no dead player. However two shots from them and you're dead. Yet the kill cam shows something far different than what you saw. And the camping....the levels are pretty damn big some of them,  and everyone just seems to camp. Especially snipers and shot gunners. Giving you no chance really. I have been playing first person shooters for years. Everything from Call of Duty, to Battlefield,  to Halo. And I have never done as bad as I have in this game. Ever. I have only had one...literally one match where I went positive. There's no regional match match making so I often get stuck with people who have very poor Internet. The result is I get 2 kills...and about 20 deaths on average simply due to hitmarkers not registering.  I even get delayed kills. When I shoot a guy full of lead, and get mowed down by him. Then soon as I Spawn the hitmarkers start randomly popping up on my screen along with points for a kill. Kind of like Battlefield 4 was at launch. On top of that, there is no option to search for specific maps to play on. I have played about 30 matches now. I have the season pass (really wish I didn't buy it cause I would get rid of this game if I hadn't but it's the last call of duty I will ever buy and it's really so me and my buddies can play) and I have yet to play anything.. ANYTHING outside of nuketown and 4 other maps. I always get popped into the same maps. On top of that, you can Spawn, promptly get killed,  Spawn again..AND GET KILLED BY THW SAME GUY AS SOON AS YOU SPAWN. But it doesn't end their. As if twice wasn't enough,  I have had it happen as many as four times in a row. You can Spawn right in the middle of the map just to get sniped as soon as you Spawn. I have even spawned in front of one of the enemy ground drones....I lasted less than four seconds.  And this happens in every...single...match. I have never gotten so mad at a game before.  Not even that I'm losing... Just that it's basically unplayable.  Now I wasn't sure if it was just me experiencing these things so I did some research..... There are forums FULL of these same complaints.  And no word from the developers on if or when they may be patched. Now my biggest issue isn't really any of what I previously explained. My biggest issue is not only does this game not work (zombies is terrific,  a lot of fun, and the offline modes are mostly error free except the A.I. Is horrible. You can run around a map with a full enemy A.I. team just to find them all standing in a corner.  That happens a lot. Fun fact though...the A.I. Won't just sit there.....they tbag. It's kind if funny sometimes)  but now you basically HAVE to play online of you want to unlock all the weapons which you get by spending crypto keys in the black market. To put this in perspective... I spent ten bucks on I think 1000 cod points, got all rare supply drops....all I got was taunts and paint schemes.... I have also spent about 90 hours playing this and I eventually unlocked a weapon...a crossbow.  Without these crypto keys that you can either play about... 15 matches to get thirty of them for a rare drop which is immensely time consuming,  and HOPE you get something (most don't and you do get duplicates of stuff. Each drop only unlocks three things at a time and many items you can only equip at certain ranks, making them pretty useless if you're a level 20 like me. Btw leveling up takes FOREVER.  It's painfully long.) or you can drop stupid amounts of money to buy them and often still end up with nothing you want. Some of these weapons are pretty damn powerful especially the shotgun. So it's essentially become a pay to win game. Or pay to access content already built into the game is a better description. You can't access the majority of this stuff offline by the way.  Those weapons that are supply drop locked you can not use offline without first buying them. Along with the all the melee weapons (aside from the starter knife) and most of the camos and character costume parts. Seriously just avoid this game. Please. I really wish I didn't buy it. It could be really really fun but it was just executed poorly and with maximum profits in mind instead of the fans and gamers themselves.  Keep in mind this is really the ONLY reliable franchise that Activision has right now so I suppose it was just a matter of time. If not for the pay to unlock system and how poorly the game functions online, this would be a great game. Not original,  not even a little,  but at least fun.

I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made. I was one of the 1,000 beta testers of Diablo II. I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3. I WAS a fan-boy. I think the activision/blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company.

#1 COMPLAINT -IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY-
Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me. In hell mode, not even inferno mode, with max gear bought off the auction house, I die in 1 hit from normal mobs. I am a witch doctor. This game is supposed to be a hack and slash. Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back, even in harder difficulties, like Diablo II was. Granted it should have hard moments, but you shouldn't hit a brick wall every 2 minutes, that is if you can even get past the first brick wall. There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly. Instant death is around every corner. It makes the game a horribly painful experience. And the instant death is often quite cheap. For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you. A mob can die, and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you, which is especially horrible for melee classes. They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you, and a laser that rakes across you, killing you instantly. Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1-hit you. You cannot esc quit. There are no counters to these things. It doesn't matter what your skill level is, you will die, and die, and die. In multiplayer games, players simply drop out when there are mobs like these. You will not be able to do a play-through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up.

-HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE-
In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty. I wouldn't even consider making a hardcore mode character. In Diablo II I had a couple level 90+ hardcore's. That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III, all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn't die with my hardcore character, but if I did starting over was still fun. With Diablo III, you die so much it's pointless to even try. It's not fun at all, just 100% guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss-step, but on an undefeatable foe.

-CHINESE BOT-FARM AUCTION HALL-
Auto farming bots that farm gold 24/7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item. A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty, and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don't get hit. So if you are a legit player, you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China. And blizzard gets a whopping 15% cut. Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was, and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn't care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition.

-CONCLUSION-
This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore-hell-mode diablo II was, this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game.

""Look at me, I'm so cool because I have a PSP.  PSPs are for grown ups, you know.  Only little 4 year old kids play Nintendo.""  It's ironic how the ""mature"" gamers are saying such immature things.  (Most of these ""mature"" gamers are in their teens, oddly enough.  I laugh at any loser who is above the age of 20 and says these kinds of things.  lol losers.)  Anyhow, that was just my rant about some of the Sony fanboys, now onto the PSP.

The first thing you'll notice about the PSP is that it's quite sleek and provacative.  It's an eye-catcher for sure, but's that's about the only thing it's good for, show.  Here I'll list of a few things that make the PSP very undesirable.

The Screen.  OK so you look at the screen and notice just how large and sharp it is compared to Nintendo's GBA SP and NDS.  However, there is a major drawback with it because it's plagued with a lot of dead pixels.  I cannot stand playing with dead pixels because they always divert my attention from the game (of course that's not such a big problem seeing as how the PSP has no games worth playing).  Also, since it is so large, it gets in the way of the Square button, making it unresponsive, and making enjoyment an impossibility.

The Design.  Again, the screen gets in the way of the square button.  The analogue ""stick"" is not designed well.  And the whole thing looks derivative.  It is also ver fragile.  Sometimes I feel like I could break it just by holding it.

Controls.  It may just be me but I hate all of Playstation's controls.  They suck.  I hate the d-pad and the analogue stick give my hand cramps.

Games.  Sports, racing, puzzle, and more SPORTS!!!  Proof that the PSP is for casual gamers.  (All the other games belonging to other genres aren't worth playing either.)  Not to mention some are rehashes of games already one the PS2.  Come on now, why waste time playing a handheld when you can be playing on a console, or better yet, a PC?

Multimedia Feautes.  They are crap and completely unnecessary.  They just eat up the battery life and your wallet.  There are other, cheaper, much better electronics that specialize in these arears.

Cost.  This is the big one.  The ""value"" pack comes with crap and it still costs me $250?  Rip off.  And that's only for the unit.  A game cost around $40 alone.  I listen to about 1 gig of music daily so throw away another $100 for a memory stick.  And if I wanted to get a UMD like an idiot, that'd be another $20.  So that's $410 (and I'm being modest here) for such a faulty product.  Ridiculous.

There are other, minor slights that I have with the PSP but they're passable.  I truly do not recommend this to anyone.  Not now anyway.  Wait a few years until the price goes down, Sony fixes the mistakes with this product, and there are games actually worth playing.  So that means you can rule out purchasing this fiasco forever.  Don't give into Sony's greedy exploits.  Don't buy the PSP!",Casual Rubbish,1121472000,8,,

Lightning is rude and mean and ditches weaker ""allies"" all the time for no reason and I cannot believe anyone can like this character she has no soul. Hope is a little B**** if I've ever seen one and I cannot believe the unrealistic grudge he has on another character who is one of the nicest personalities in the whole game. Oh and he likes to mumble about things like ""there is no hope for us (no pun intended....)"" or ""only thing awaiting us is quick death"" what the hell? really this kid is messed up on so many levels and his mom must have not liked him either because she abandoned him to go join a dumb fight that ended up killing her.

Vanille is apparently a ""kid"" as she is referred that way by another character many times but she looks adult, and acts like a 7 year old would. She is brainless and I believe she suffers from a congenital defect that has impaired her intelligence level quite a bit.

All these characters have no real objectives, bicker all the time (just so that they can have cut-scenes every 5 minutes) and they change their views, goals, and whatever all the time that it is best to disregard anything that come out of their stupid mouths because they don't make much sense.

Lightning is like ""I am going to save Serah"" and then when Snow says ""I am going to save Serah"", she is like ""that's impossible."" and then when Lightning is left with Hope, she is like ""Snow is going to save Serah""

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

Vanille is like ""Let's go Hope, you have something to say to Snow."" so they follow Snow, and then when they meet him, neither of them mention why they are here, so Snow disregards them. And as soon as Snow leaves, Hope is like ""I HAS SOMETHING TO TELL SNOW!! GRRRR"" and Vanille is like ""Oh yeah. You need to tell him."" and same thing repeats about 5 times.

Snow tells Hope's mother ""Are you sure you want to fight?"" Mom ignores Hope and is like ""hell yeah let's go fight"" and dies. And then tells Snow, ""please take care of him"" and Snow is left puzzled ""save WHO?"" Really? Obviously her son you idiot..... And when Hope reveals his grudge Snow is shocked ""OMG now it all makes sense to me""

So in a nutshell, horrible story matched by an equally unappealing gameplay involving HOURS of a very narrow linear path following involving different, but equally dumb characters

The graphics, while dated, are fine to me.  The problems are, firstly, the controls.  Never once do I feel like I have control over my player.  I keep hitting X to kick the make my board move.  Nothing.  Then, I do tricks.  So, things go fine at first.  Then, you will think you are even for a landing and fall.  The falling is hilarious.  It is like a rag doll being thrown.

Then, the people skating around are annoying.  I got hit a few times as well as hitting others.  You just skate around, with awful controls.

The missions.  Well, there seem to be none.  You see little icons.  You go to one and it has things you can do.  I thought it would be fun.  It is not.  The controls make it so hard to do.

There is not talking in the game.  I have played for, maybe 30 minutes and there is nobody saying anything.

However, with all of the other unlucky owners who have been having overheating problems with their systems, I felt compelled to protect my 360.  Sure, Microsoft extended the warranty to 3 years, but why be without my 360 for several weeks if it can be avoided?  For a long time I sat and wondered if buying an external cooler was necessary.  After playing through Saints Row and having the game freeze or stall on me several times, I was convinced I should.  So I bought myself this Nyko Intercooler thinking ""aside from spending 20 unnecessary bucks, what can it hurt?""

Apparently a lot.  Fortunately I realized this before it too late but this thing was doing more harm than good, and for others who have purchased this, it was too late, and it killed their 360.  Apparently drawing power from the 360 makes it even more prone to overheating.
Technically, it works.  It's easy to install, and the fans increase airflow.  But what difference does it make if the fans work if it overheats the 360 anyway?  Oh and if I'm not mistaken, Microsoft's warranty doesn't cover damage done by this product because it's an unlicensed product.  Super!

I should note that aside from the problems in Saints Row, which I've found are from flaws in the game's engine itself and not the actual hardware, I had never had problems with my 360.

It was not full of action nor finger-biting tension or anything. It was just another game that was poorly done and not able to deliver even mild enjoyment. I hated this game, and that's not for lack of trying either. I tried on four separate occasions to try to finish this atrocity, but it just wasn't worth the time it took to load it.

Graphically, yes, it was fair, the concept was very nice. But again, it's a game where the developers apparently think that graphics and a cool idea are enough to carry a game to stardom, instead of actual fulfillment of the idea and enjoyable gameplay.

However, be advised that this game - even the boxed DVD edition - requires authentication through the Steam online system, and once that game is registered to your Steam account, it can't be ""unregistered"" or used by any other (new) Steam account.

I've been in contact with Steam's woefully inadequate tech support - only available through email - and was so advised.

When you create a Steam account (for those, like me, who are unfamiliar with it) you have to authenticate your account through an email verification process. That means that if you want to transfer the account - which would be necessary if you want to give or sell your game to someone else when you're done playing it - you'd have to be directly involved in manipulating the system to give that third party access to and control over the Steam account you created. Further, you can't delete or cancel your Steam account.

What this means, for all practical purposes, is that this game is designed to be playable only by the original purchaser.

Now, I don't know about you, but when I buy any other property - books, movies, cars, houses, whatever - when I'm done with them, I can sell or give them to someone else to enjoy. That, after all, is one of the key elements of actually ""owning"" a piece of property.

Well... not so with this game. You're paying fifty bucks to essentially RENT this game on a permanent basis.

It is.

Others say it has the best graphics in the series.

It does.

So what's missing? In my opinion, just about everything that made GTA San Andreas such a blast to play.

You can't customize your character's physique by working out. You can't get tattoos, or increase your fighting ability. Niko starts the game off wimpy in hand-to-hand combat- and stays that way to the very end.

In GTA 4, you could improve your fighting, shooting and driving abilities to near- super-human capabilities. It wasn't 'realistic' (which one of GTA IV's selling points).

It was fun. And while GTA IV's environment is better- rendered and more realistic, it is far smaller and less diverse  than GTA San Andreas.

GTA San Andreas built upon its predecessors by creating a more vast, varied environment that included urban and wooded areas.

And all of GTA IV's predecessors  had one thing in common: by the time you got to the end of the game, you had tons of money and pretty much ran the whole town.

DRIVING

The driving in GTA IV is also tedious and frustrating.

There are many missions where you have to chase someone down in an automobile. These missions require that you drive at high speeds through the traffic- congested maze that is Liberty City.

And  the vehicles handle nothing like they did in the original series. They veer out-of-control easily.

After about five missions, this got tiresome for me and frustrating.

You can chase someone for seemingly endless miles, lose them, and then have to start he whole thing over again.

There was one mission where I was chasing down someone, only to have giant metal pipes fall in the middle of the  road and cut me off. And I failed the mission.

And so many of the great stuff I liked about the other games are gone.

Today's experience with Microsoft has been an absolute eye opener as far as the quality of their products and their complete lack of service overall. I have had my 360 system for a few years and bought the elite and newer models of the systems to avoid the problems that everyone else was experiencing with their consoles. This morning I went to turn on my 360 to experience the dreaded red ring of death that I have heard about so many times from so many of my friends. So I called Microsoft to see if I can have it repaired only to get the answer that my warranty had expired mere days ago. They did however offer to repair the system for half the price of a brand new system ($100 the new xbox 360 being released in a month retails at $199) with no mention of an upgraded warranty after this one would have gotten fixed. Naturally I decided to decline especially since I had a backup system upstairs (my fiancee's). I got to play one game for about a half hour and decided to switch to a different game, low and behold a second system broken in one day, this time the drive door would not open, not to worry this system was made later and should still be under warranty right?

2.0,False,"11 28, 2010",A386S7CE0QEJY4,B002BSA1C6,Red Baron,"This game took forever to come out and I have to say I am super disappointed,  this game could have and should have been much better then it is,  the plus sides of this game are that it's Gran Turismo,  even this lackluster game is decent,  I will play it a little bit longer and then switch back  to 4, or 3, on the ps2.  I have played every single one of these games,  I have to have them as soon as they come out I love the games,  but this one is so lack luster.  I can go through the things that have put me off from the game, and then finish up with a little closing.

1.  this game is TINY,  they may have 1'000's of cars but who cares if you only nine categories of races per challenge level,  and some only have one race.  Case in point, I think gt4 had 16 endurance races,  prologue for this game had four sections c,b,a, and s with 10 races per section I have not gotten all the way through but this game has around 20 races per section and 5 sections, so it has around 100 races for the gt mode, compared to the 110 races in gran turismo 4 witch was on the ps2, with much less disk space.  I thought that game was short, but this game took four times as long to come out, it should give more to the customers, then the prologue it gave us years ago.

2.  NO CARRY OVER,  part of the reason I eventually got the prologue was because it said that it would give a head start of gt5,  I spent a lot of time getting cars and money to transfer over to gt5 to save time later on, only to find out that the company changed their mind and took out this feature.

3.  B-spec is a joke this time around,  they tried to change it and made it stupid and worse then it was in GT4,  the drivers are stupid,  all the races are the same, so you get to watch an AI do a race you just mopped the floor with lose in slow motion,  I have great cars, and I cream the other cars, then I switch over to B-spec and watch my driver lose with the exact same car,  the leveling up is slow for the AI, driver, so you have to do the low level races a lot just to get the driver able to shift out of fourth gear,  I watched one of my drivers on a straight away and he never shifted out of fourth no matter what Command I gave him.  B-Spec drivers are super lame,  and it take to long to get them experience, and then when they have it, they still suck.

4.  I out the 8GB of information on my hard drive, and the load times are still very long for every race,  once the race is started however you can restart inside of the race as many times as you like, with out load times, so if you want to save time, restart if you feel bad about a race after the first or second lap.

5.  Physics is a bitch in this game, so often in the licenses and tests I would try and steer the car around a corner only to lose control,  If the point of the physics in this game is frustrate the hell of of players well then they are spot on.

6.  they added other cars to some of the challenges in the licenses section,  witch drives me crazy if a car hits you, you are disqualified,  and they hit you a lot.

7.  the license is different then in the last games,  I see no point to them any more,  you gain points through game play, that gives you levels, but as long as you drive a lot it does not seem like you need to pass the licenses,  I did not get much experience from passing the licenses, I have all of the except for the super which I am waiting to see if I need to get it in order to play the extreme races,  but it seems to be for casual games who may not be very good at the licensee portion of the game which was tougher in gt4.  This game should have changed it so you could choose how you want to advance through the game, licensee, points or what they had a combination of the two,  so that games could have control over how they play the game, instead of being shoe horned.

8.  Cars are good, but the races are centered around cars, I cold care less about, why have a raced centered around a little crap car I would never buy, it seems obvious that car companies got better treatment based on certain factors.

So, in conclusion, this is Gran Turismo 5,  we have been waiting a long time for it,  I think you might want to wait until it hits the greatest hits or drops in price, or pick up a used copy, because this game is going to have a lot of dlc,  I paid 30 bucks for this game, and feel like I overpaid for the amount and quality of the races,  Really disappointed in the lack of endurance races so far, you can not even look at what the future races are until you level up,  I have every licensee but the super, and I can not see the final group of races.  I am curious how gran turismo will justify new races to be downloaded after sticking people with a 60 dollar price tag for the game, as well as the lack of a bridge between, this game and the called prologue.

Edit: Have been playing the game more, and they have made some major screws loose,  I played forever to save up to get a f1 race car, and after I saved up 10,000,000.00 credits, and spent it all, it turns out that car can not be used in the regular races,  but their was no warning before I spent the credits, so a couple of days of saving up and selling other cars was a complete waste,  thats BS they should warn you,  also I can not even figure out where the race is for this car.  And on top of it, they do not warn you that the car can not be sold, that is such a stupid waste, other games WARN you before they have you buy things that can not be sold, or changed after you buy them,  this is SO LAME.",Disappointed Big Time,1290902400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Most Wanted brought us a great environment, good (albeit cheesy at times) cop chases, but most importantly: a game that, when you played it, felt n smooth and creamy - opposed to choppy and slapped together.

But lets quickly examine the pros:
1) Car detail - the 360 (and surely the PS3 as well) pumps out some amazing detail. Tread on tires, creases on the panels, and even the inside dash - can't go wrong.

2) Car upgrades and tuning - Very precise (or so it seems). Customize each aspect as you like it - and they even give you a ""test"" to estimate how you will function on the road. Great for shaving split seconds off your race time.

3) Works nicely with a racing wheel.

The cons:
1) Track Racing - I think the most obvious downfall of track racing is the ease of - and over use of - using the same piece of track for about 300 different races. And prostreet does this perfectly - EVEN WHEN AT DIFFERENT BATTLE MACHINES (supposedly different geographic locations). And all the other cons with track racing follow too: plain and similar backgrounds, lack of excitement, no traffic, and certainly, no cops. Lastly, Nascar has some great tracks - boring, in my opinion, but many love it - which is probably better suited to the track lovers.

2) Informational Messages - I'm just plainly sick of EA's tree hugging ""don't race"" messages, this is a game not a defensive driving course - save it! I also imagine their ""don't race on the street"" message has something to do with the track racing the game is based on, and their lame attempts to convey the gratification of local race track notoriety - bah! Not so important, but feels good to vent about. :)

3) Car damage - I'm unsure if this is a good thing, a bad thing, or just out of balance. Let's just say it's not horribly hard to rack up a repair cost twice the value of the income from the race - especially since YOU pay when THEY hit YOU. They attempt to offset this with repair markers, but the whole system feels off - decide for yourself.

4) Cash or microsoft points? - So how do YOU want to spend your hard earned real life currency? If you have enough, you can simply buy your car - and its upgrades! Microsoft points are interchangeable with game cash, the average car cost is about 200 MSP - roughly $2.50 US. I imagine the question that EA answered with this feature was, ""How can we make money off people renting the game?"" Heck, lets take it one step further: Exactly how much do you think the upgrades will cost, in both game and real world currency, for that car you couldn't afford in the first place? I'm guessing the real genius of this plot unfolds at precisely this point - when you realize you your in-game check book can't balance the costs and you start waving around your credit card for more MSP.

5) No Cops - But why should there be any? It was only the BEST feature of Most Wanted - and Carbon took a stab at butchering this aspect by implementing nothing but straight roads, where losing cops isn't realistic, likely, or even fun (imo, anyway). The cop chases, which for me was the defining aspect of replay value - was probably replaced by the xbox live online portion.

So let me sum this game up quickly: Your driving your choice of many real world cars around a variety of tracks that pretty much all look the same, you cross the finish line a few times as #1, you dominate a ""race day"" - which wins you a few bucks and a choice of 6 prizes - many of which, part-wise, you probably already own (mostly lvl1-2 for a while). When you're done, you begin the same thing over - at a new ""battle machine,"" with strikingly similar backgrounds, but probably one major difference: off the road... is SAND not dirt... Or dirt, not a fence...

Godfather II exemplifies this experience. In all honesty, if I had waited to read the user reviews here I would not have purchased the game new right off the bat for $60. I would have waited for a used copy or rented it when I was home sick with the flu. Lesson learned.

Overall the game has major problems. I don't compare it so much to the movie as I do to the first Godfather on PS2. The biggest flaw is a general sense of repetition and a lack of creativity.

Pros:
*I like the crew aspect and the AI is very good on your crew members. Makes for a nice strategy.
*Molotovs make for an amazing fire display during heated battles
*Despite it's flaws it does offer compelling and downright addictive gameplay. You take over one business and you just want more, more, more!
*I like being able to customize all the wardrobe details
*Cuba offers a very unique game play setting with stone buildings and military police checkpoints
*Some of the businesses (i.e. oil rig) offer very cool layouts
*Shooting and aiming is user friendly, similar to GF I

CONS (and there are a lot):
*Awkward screen controls. XY axis is hard to control the view angle.
*Frustrating vertical mazes do not equal challenging puzzle play. Just trying to maneuver around is constantly thwarted by not being able to jump off of a surface or get over a low barrier. If a window if 3 feet high you can vault it but if it's 3.4 feet high you have to go 300 feet to get around?
*GF I offered repetitive business takeovers and compounds, but these were offset by interesting missions and some difficulty in opponents. Missions here are just lame. There's no challenge, no strategy, no puzzle to figure out, just find 'em and off 'em. Opponent AI is just too easy with no ability to adjust difficulty level.
*Driving is too much like real life--it's a slow, tedious way to get from one place to another rather than part of the game itself. There are no interesting chases, races or getaways.
*You have to play online to upgrade your weapon license. It's one thing to offer perks for online play, but to make it necessary for completion? Essentially if you don't have high speed internet (doesn't everyone?) you have to off your crew members as you go along to get new ones who use better weapons. Some omerta! Very uncool.
*Too short! I finished the anticlimactic finale in 3 days. And the game has very little replay value.
*Movie scenes are more about exposition than moving your character's story line along. I understand it's a game not a movie adaptation, but when the source material is this good and the first game stuck so close to the movie, there is an expectation for a certain level of authenticity that is lost by this much straying.
*Dying or getting arrested has no real penalty. You don't lose your stuff or much money and you just go right back to where you left off. Although in theory this sounds great, what it does is lower the stakes to where you just don't care so much if you live or die, in essence ruining the excitement and/or suspense and muting any victories attained.
*Every moment of the game is dominated by a sense that it could have been so much more. If I can think of it, the programmers should have too.

2.0,True,"11 16, 2015",AK884VX5S74ZW,B00XUZBCVI,MacGyver,"I really wanted to like this game but the exact same gameplay issues that plagued NHL 15 are alive and well in NHL 16.  I think the only noticeable improvement is that checking seems tightened up slightly.  Aside from that, here's a list of problems:

-One timers are still near impossible to perform.  You get a two on one, make the perfect pass, and WHIFF.  Your player takes a slapshot while the puck is still six feet away.

-Positioning is ridiculous no matter how you tweak the strategy settings.  The AI is clueless on how to generate offense.  Your teammates never try to get open but instead take up awkward positions on the ice and allow themselves to be covered by defenders.  You're practically forced to take shots from the blue line and hope for a deflection or screen from traffic in front of the net.  Trying any type of cross ice pass in the offensive end is guaranteed to fail.

-Defensive positioning is equally as bad.  If the opponent fires the puck down the ice and I'm racing toward it in the corner, why do I have my own teammate directly behind me racing at it full speed?  He should peel off and head to the opposite side of the ice, not check me into the boards.

-Board play is almost always won by the computer player.  If I'm checked along the boards and knocked down, the computer player always manages to skate around me and strip the puck.  Conversely, if I check down the computer player, they somehow manage to be in the perfect position to get back to their feet and regain possession every single time.

-Lastly, and THE most frustrating issue with gameplay, is that when you're switching between players, you're frequently switched to a player either not closest to the puck and/or not in a position to make a play.  This happens at least a dozen times per game.  As an example, let's say you have possession of the puck in the offensive end and you're near the boards by the goal line.  The computer strips the puck from you.  At that very moment, you have a forward high in the slot and closest to the puck that could easily check the computer player and keep the play alive.  When you switch players, it will NOT go to that player.  It instead switches to a defenseman who is already well behind the blue line and traveling out of the zone.  This allows the opposition to now clear the zone and rush up the ice.  There are countless examples of this happening where you can either clear pucks out of your zone or keep the play alive in the offensive end and your chances are ruined because you can't switch to the player best positioned to make a play.

-HUT is an absolute joke.  I have spent hours upon hours earning coins to spend on gold packs.  I would estimate I've opened a good 20+ gold packs and I've yet to get a single player above 85.  Unless you are extremely lucky or you're willing to pay hundreds of actual dollars to buy massive quantities, there's no way for the average person to generate enough coins to complete collections.  You would literally have to play the game 24/7.

-EASHL is a step above OTP (Online Team Play) from '15, but it's still not without issues.  The ability to customize your own hockey player and to rank up is fun but the process of joining and competing as a team is a broken mess.  Drop-in games are fun, but I was hoping to join a team where I knew players would actually play their positions and work together rather than play reckless just to pad their stats.  Unless you've already established a team among your friends, trying to find a legit team among the public listings is difficult.  I've joined several and have yet to play a game as a ""team"" because nobody is ever online.

So there you have it.  The added features and depth are nice and the visuals look great but gameplay issues, the heart and soul of the game, still persist.

I do know that the picture is hard to set up to get accurate color from PS3 games. The color does not have enough settings for my taste and everything seemed to be too bright or too dark. I had to adjust in game brightness and television brightness. It would be great if they send some sort of color and adjustment set up wizard disc. Wouldn't it?

The remote control is almost a joke. I am seriously glad to have it, but it has to have direct line of sight, so you have to aim over the console sitting in the box and the buttons are just furiously unresponsive. Come on bluetooth remote? Anyhow.

Overall, it is nice to have your own screen to play your games on. My Vizio Razor is so much more colorful and vibrant and has a faster response time than this screen and that 22"" only cost me $100@@. This one is obviously three and a half times that cost. But this was in a hard suitcase... Really.

Getting back on to subject. The response time does seem to lag a little bit. Even for a smaller screen the lag is still visible. I think they really should have put a little more money in to the quality of monitor purchased for this, considering the cost to the consumer and also considering the type of consumer who is wiling to lay this much money down for a game screen in a suitcase may be a bit picky about what kind of screen it is.

So yes. I really do think this is more of a complaint than a promotion on what I think about the case. The case itself is great and durable, but at the end of the day, I was more or less paying for the screen with the case as a sweet bonus for me.

I put both my Xbox360 Slim and two types of PS3 slims into this case. The new PS3 Super Slim does not work well with this case due to needing to unstrap and restrap the velcro multiple times while playing to get discs in and out. I recommend the older slim just for that reason(even at the cost of the extra weight).

So, if you have the extra cash and you can't get an LCD of your own to play on wherever your intended destination is maybe buy it.
Otherwise, pass.

The screen is not worth the cost in a whole. The remote lacks response. They should have thrown the PGE Battle Bag in for FREE for this price. I would wait for the price to go down. Or get a Super Slim LED and slip it into a bag with a towel around it ! : )'

Over time, I tried most of them: steering ships and piloting planes and conducting trains - on rainy Sunday afternoons, in a T-shirt and flannel PJ pants, in front of a 17"" TFT-panel: how immersed can one get? Honestly.
But I guess the little boy in us will always be impressed and yearn to be in the helm of great powerful machines. To prove to ourself that we can tame these beasts. So I couldn't resist and gave RAIL SIMULATOR a try. After all, it was supposed to be MICROSOFT's TRAIN SIMULATOR successor, sharing the same developer and all.

Is it realistic? Well, I am no real-life conductor, so how would I know? It would hardly be fair for me to comment on subjects that I am not an expert on, so I will refrain from doing it.
What I CAN tell you is that the game physics give off an original feeling all right. Heavier trains need a long stopping run; apply too much regulator and the wheels will slip; and one needs to master the reverser to successfully negotiate steep hills.

Graphically the game is improved compared to its ""predecessor""; the routes are delightfully recreated, as are the individual trains - and I especially liked the option to have a free-roving camera instead of just the one following the train. Yet it manages to convey a feeling of unfulfilled potential. Much better graphics are available today.

The sounds are one of the first aspects that ruin immersion - and made me withhold the first star. True, the diesels and electrics all have their own distinctive engine notes, and environmental sounds (birds and church bells) were considered a nice touch. Yet, like a badly conducted orchestra, they managed to miss their mark every time it counts. It makes no difference whether you are in or outside the cab, the sounds are the same! And who can hear birds twerping when passing by in a speeding train?

What really ruins this game's potential is the inevitability of crushing bugs - another star missed. When certain combinations of warning signals and speeds coincide: back to the desktop. Try using the 2nd map: ditto. This one got rushed into the pre-Christmas market - and it shows.

The game comes with a nice and friendly editor which lets you edit the world, and even create your own levels from scratch. Moreover, it is backed by free downloadable content [railsimulator(dot)com] from where one can get free engines, carriages, some new scenarios as well as whole new editor packs. Apparently, RS developers are counting heavily on the fan-base to come up with new models and MODs. This is supposedly a greatly supported game. Now, let's only hope they support it with some much needed patches! Don't release a half-baked game and expect the gaming community to do the rest.

Finally, such a complicated game just screams for a good ol' thick detailed manual. No such luck I am afraid - and this is where it looses its third and final star. I understand that those RS-GUIDES are not going to sell themselves - but, come on, paper is cheap, through us a freaking bone here!...

2.0,True,"03 2, 2011",A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B000GEDN5E,Robert D. Watson,"It's hard to review a game like this because there's so much going on.  Complete about half of the single player campaign, and you'll start to see what I mean.  Dancing games, shooting games, ""skill games"" which usually force you to have impeccable timing, ""sports"" games which involve you shaking your wiimotes as fast as you can, and a whole lot more.

If I were judging on variety alone, this is an easy 5-star game.  Big, big mistakes keep me from rating it highly.

The first major problem with the game is that you have to unlock EVERYTHING. Even two player mode.  And the only way to do that is to play the game in single player mode.  For what is primarily a party game, this is absurd, especially since playing on single player gives you a chance to get a handle on the unusual timing and other aspects of each game, and you'll maintain a healthy advantage over your opponents.  Some might not find this to be too problematic, but if you want to play with a group, you have no option other than to spend lots of time playing on your own, or repeating the same minigames over and over as a group.  If you get to unlock two player mode, which is very easy, you'll only have access to the four or five games you have played through on single player mode.  It's silly and annoying to have to do this, and it really sucks a lot of fun out of the game.

The second problem with the game is the difficulty level of some games.  Dancing is really easy - everyone gets a near high score on this.  Then there are games like cow tossing, or pig racing, which you have to play dozens of times just to come close.  There are a LOT of ""wagglefest"" games, where you and your partner just shake the wiimote as rapidly as possible, often for a minute or more at a time.  These are especially frustrating when you fail them on single player mode, because after a single try, your arm will really hurt (especially the carrot juice shooting game).  Making this even more problematic, we noticed while playing that the game is not particularly responsive to movement of the controls, particularly with the nunchuk.  The slow response times make some of the difficult games nearly impossible.

Finally, the game is party friendly, but two people never get to play the same game at the same time.  This is not a problem with some of the minigames, but playing with four people on dance modes is very aggravating, since each person must play the same song every time.  Other games require you to do something for a long time, and with four people, it can take a good ten minutes or more to complete a single round.  This is an annoyance more than a legitimate complaint, since this is certainly a design decision.  Some games simply wouldn't work on a small screen that accomodates multiple people, while others would be very crowded if more were to join in.

Parents of younger children might find some of the games a little on the vulgar or too violent side, but this game is aimed more at teenagers or adults, so it won't be a problem for most.  If you don't want your young child exposed to pretty consistent bathroom humor, however, this is not a good choice.","Vulgar Variety, but too many serious issues",1299024000,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

Pros
+Still the old school Spyro gameplay - collecting gems, collecting a key item (in this game it was dragonflies)
+Can shoot bubbles, ice, and thunder (my personal favorite) instead of just fire now.
+Has all the abilities from the past Spyro games so you don't have to necessarily reobtain them.

Cons
-Only one world, with 8 levels (9 if you count the 'home' world)
-The 8 levels can get dull and hard to find, especially if you're missing 1 gem.
-The minigames are kind of boring and repeated over the course of the 8 levels, except in the luau level with the drums, and the jungle where you had to climb that massive tower.
-The game gets laggy in a speedrun stage.
-The bubble breath is really useless, only used for catching dragonflies.
-The 'wing shield' is also extremely useless, used in one level to get one dragonfly, plus the hit redirection is backwards.
-Moneybags is only met ONCE in the entire game, and it's in the first level. You only need to pay him 200 gems and that's it. Gems aren't used in the rest of the game except for 100% completion, and you don't get the gems you paid back like you did in the other games.
-The final boss is kind of hard at first but really stupid once you figure out the pattern (or just go on GameFAQs and find out how to kill him)
-The game took less than 10 hours for me to beat. It is really short.

I honestly thought this game could've been a lot better being on stronger and better hardware than a PS1. They did pretty good with the GBA version that came out BEFORE this one. I don't see why they couldn't follow it.

""Better than Unity...?""

I was hoping that after the failure that was Unity and Rogue, Ubisoft would have thought of some way to revitalize the series. Luckily, I did not bet
on that thought. While Syndicate is better than Unity, it's still pretty much garbage. The graphics are so bad, I was actually laughing. I'm not sure how this can look worse than Black Flag (which came out in 2013 and was made for previous generations, as well), but it does.

The controls are as clunky and box-like as ever. Same engine after all these years.

Combat is the same. No change. One button to attack, one to parry and one that stops range attackers, which prompts you during a combo, so you won't have to be bothered to put effort in. The fighting is a bit more flashy, though. While it looks a lot cooler, it makes no sense when you think of them as ""Assassins"". Assassin's are quick, precise and deadly. Not brawling showoffs.

Again with this ""create a team of Assassin-like people"" crap. I think we've all had enough of the 5 hours of missions to collect henchmen.

The era is just overdone, in my opinion. Victorian London, I get it. People talk funny and drink a lot. Enough is enough.

There are too many negatives about playing Grand Theft Auto III due to numerous useless and pointless missions, limitedness of freedom, repetitive playing, constant use of X button, lack of ability to save the game when needed, and ridiculous storyline and miscellaneous information. Let me get the positives out of the way first. For one, Grand Theft Auto III looks cool for its playing features, and the ideas of what to expect are of high level. There is a plenty to do around each of three islands. It took me about a couple of months to beat Grand Theft Auto III, so more bang out of the money. Several special types of missions are fun such as rampages and unique jumps. Now for the negatives as they are many of them. Novelty of a game can only wear off that it's no longer replayable. Grand Theft Auto III is no exception to this case. I beat this game a while ago, and I showed some interest in playing it again few years later. What I had forgotten about Grand Theft Auto III is how monotonous the game is. I perfectly outlined my objectives for each island of three: Cab, Fire, Cop, Jumps, Packages, RC Rampages, and Missions. Each of them (not the RC anyway) takes too damned long to finish. The worst aspect of Grand Theft Auto III is the dreadful Ambulance mission. It takes a good two hours to finish this one; there are twelve levels (level 1, save one person; level 2, save two persons; etc.). If the ambulance is either flipped over or shot up, I am back to square one and must do it all over again. In the midst of this, there is no allowing of saving at any point of the mission. It has to be completely done from start to finish. Actually, I reached level 12 and saved nine people. Then suddenly, I flipped the ambulance over not because I wasn't paying attention but my thumb literally got tired. Of course, my mind got numbed, and I grew frustrated at the idea of doing it again. I understand that those missions along with cab, fire, and cop are to familiarize myself with the geography of each island. My suggestion to improve the game play, why not just have 20 cab missions on one island, 20 fire the second island, and 20 cop for third island? Maybe ten levels of ambulance are okay and allow me to begin at the highest level possible where I screwed up. Whenever I am doing something on each island, ninety percent of the time my thumb is constantly on the X button. It gets sore after a while. The tedious driving around and going from point A to point B can be thought of preliminary stages of Alzheimer's. It's no fun. As for the real missions, they are all right for RPG but nothing special. The storyline is ridiculous at best; why not get the main character to make a name for himself as he rises to the top as Mafia hood boss or something? Speaking of the protagonist, who is he? What is his name? What does he really look like? What can he do? What is he interested in? The statistics are helpful, but must I know how many inches of rain fell, or total people wasted, or weight of explosives used, or total amount of money paid by cops? When I pointed out limitedness of freedom, mainly I have objectives that I must complete and when I am in midst of them, I feel the rigidity that I must follow this way and no other way. The game is not actually hard to beat, but it's not that easy either. All in all, Grand Theft Auto III is full of cycles repeated to death until 100% completion is reached. When that is accomplished, is there a sense of satisfaction? Not really.

The quests are always the same.  Kill a target monster, find an item, find a person, etc.  So you take a quest, enter the dungeon, take another, enter the dungeon again, take another..you get the point.  You'll be visiting the same dungeon quite a few times before you can take the quest that will take you to a new dungeon.

I was very intrigued at the notion of an action game where the goal is not to kill as many people as possible, but to achieve an objective without anyone knowing you were even there. Great idea. Unfortunately, the result is not so pleasant.
 For starters, it is very nearly impossible to complete the missions in the manner the game suggests--quietly, without much unnecessary bloodshed. As an example (and without giving too much away) there is a mission with the objective of sniping a Russian bigwig through the window. You are dropped off at the subway nearby and have to navigate through roadblocks and patrolling guards to set up your kill point in a nearby apartment. Cool idea, right? Expect the sniper gun is stashed in a locker in the bloody subway. That's right. In the middle of the afternoon, in a crowded city subway station. How do you nonchalantly carry a four-foot sniper rifle through downtown St. Petersburg, and not alert any civilians or the dozen or so guards patrolling the neighborhood? Oh, that's right, you can't. Why didn't the shadowy ops who left your gear in the subway not simply leave them in the apartment? Oh, that's right, because its a game and you need an unrealistic challenge. So you're left with two options: blasting your way through every guard post you find, then setting up for your 'stealthy' kill from afar, or leaving the rifle in the locker and attempting the equally ridiculous feat of sniping the Russian with your handgun. Utterly ridiculous.  And let me remind you, before you simply write this off as someone who doesn't want a challenge in the game: this is your FIRST mission.  There is zero margin for error.  Where's the learning curve?  Am I the only one who did not buy the first Hitman?
  In yet another level, you are expected to choose your kill point from several different areas, then set it up.  The only problem is that you have no time to case the neighborhood, because the target is only in area for a few minutes.  You have nothing to go on but a cumbersome map interface and some incredibly vague instructions from your employer.  You can't even jump over curbs or low (2 feet high) walls.  This is realism?
  Amazingly, despite these glaring discrepancies, this game was touted by its producers--and hailed by consumers--as realistic.  Only in today's video-game driven culture would this in any way be considered realistic.  If the targets were really this hard and they absolutely needed to be taken out (to the tune of a six-figure fee), why wouldn't they just be strafed by a gunship?

I had rumble off, volume off, power saving on, and brightness was set to 1. For $11 (it was on sale in November 2013 here), I'd say it was well worth it. The minor irritation is that it adds a little weight to the gamepad which takes time to adjust to. The sale is over on Amazon but still ongoing via GameStop.com, although you'd also have to pay shipping.

The official competitor is the Nintendo high-capacity battery for $32. This can only be purchased directly from Nintendo (store.nintendo.com) - They promise up to 8 hours of use but also mention factors like brightness setting,  temperature and usage of wireless communications will reduce that. No change in weight or appearance, but it's $32.

Now I just got the Nyko uBoost. I can't say for sure if it will last long or if I can expect the same results in a couple of months. But as for how it faired right out of the box, I'm impressed. Good deal. For someone who gets really consumed by a game and has the luxury to play all day, I would probably recommend combining the Nintendo HC battery with the Nyko uBoost.

First I had to figure out which ones I needed (they did not download automatically) and then find them (the publisher offers only torrent files) and then load them in order.

I had to run it with an online connection because it only once recognized the CD and never again. Once I got it up and running I had a lot of crashes and freezes. I finally uninstalled the game, completely.

2.0,False,"08 9, 2012",A2XJBAYDKQY463,B004774IPU,J. Vasen,"I hear this was loved by professional reviewers and the only reason I can think of is that the graphics are very pretty especially compared to Civ IV. I'm a more functional person and I loved IV. I am also a very big fan of strategy, turn-based games, but this one overdoes some of those features.
This game is:
-slow - many more clicks for same features as in 4 and unless you have a lightning gamer PC, each click takes time.
-buggy - for example when viewing the production queue for one city you may actually be looking at a different city; sometimes you click a production queue and it comes back to the same city to select again; and many others
-dizzying - the way it moves around from one unit to the next, i.e. the camera slides across the map and it seems like it never goes next to the closest unit
-delays - process time between turns seems endless especially in the beginning, and I have a quad processor.
It would be nice to say they improved from IV to V and some changes are great - for example ranged attacks.
On the other hand many other things are a definite step back. Not the least of which is the feeling you are playing in molasses due to the delays and bugs.
And why did they change the definitions of buildings so much. I played a few hours before I realized that basic buildings like Granary, Forge, Aqueduct and others were nothing like they were in Civ IV. I know it was explained, but do you always read every detail of a game you think you know.
Another peeve is not being able to stack units. It gives a completely different feel to the war part of the game. I find it irritating, although strategically challenging, to avoid getting units clogged up in some areas. Workers getting stalled because they can't stack is especially irritating.
Civ IV would tell you what a worker was building if you moused over it. In V you have to click it and then close it.
In V you can't tell as much about a unit, such as how far you are til next promotion. and promotions slow down big time after the first 3 or so. In IV I would get 10 or more promotions for a unit, but in V, I don't think I've gotten past 4 promotions.
On the both plus and minus side is notifications. It's nice that you can't miss something important because the game forces you to deal with every notification. On the other hand, the game FORCES you to deal with every notification, which contributes to the slow feel of the game.
City-states is a nice idea, but I think there are too many.
Another feature I'm convinced is a bug, but might be just a very irritating feature of the rules -- your own cities will tell you they want some resource. And eventually every city tells you this. And for some reason, with ""pearls"", every city will decide on one turn that it is happy you have pearls, and then demand them again on the next, spawning dozens of notifications. (I guess I could ignore them, but other notifications get interspersed in there too.)
The easier difficulties are pretty easy.
Some new features that could be nice and are definitely different ways of thinking:
-wonders can require that you have all of a certain kind of building in every city you own
-great persons seem to spawn more often, but wonders don't spawn them as often
-happiness is empire wide and not related to cities
-there is no dirty factor (green faces)
-there is a new entity called a culture policy. You can select various bonuses once you've reached the empire wide culture goal, and that goal goes up each time
-there is no domination victory for land and population percentage
-you can see your progress toward a golden age, and a new culture policy
-bombers and fighters take damage even if the target has no anti-aircraft

2.0,True,"11 16, 2014",AHIHM3F4P24TF,B00BFOEY3Y,Banon,"I dislike writing bad reviews, but this product just seemed like a good example of slipshod design, especially for the price.

BUTTONS:
I honestly hated the wheel.  I have tried a couple of the G-series mouses that have the hyperscroll toggle.  On those that have it, the ""stepped"" setting has always rattled, felt really loose/cheap.  It kind of feels like a wheel that has had the resistance worn out of it.

I really like the side buttons on this mouse, but they seemed to vary slightly in resistance and feedback.  The extra buttons for the index finger were not comfortable to feel out and hit on the fly.  I believe part of this is because many of the functions I would assign them would be tied to a left click, so I would have to basically shift my index finger back and forth rapidly between selecting an ability and targeting that ability in a game.

I think it would have been far more effective to have them on either side of the mouse, instead, independent of the index finger. If all you need are 4 extra buttons, then you can simply use the index-finger buttons for DPI or profile switching.

BATTERY/CHARGING:
Battery life is a joke.  The DPI and response performance of this mouse is superior to the G602 on paper, but frankly I think the practicality of the vastly superior battery life of the G602 trumps that.  2500 DPI is plenty fast for 90% of people, anyway.

Worse yet, if you want to plug it in and treat it as a wired mouse, the DPI/Profile indicator LEDs will blink/cycle FOREVER.  Even if you pull the battery, they still cycle.  I considered putting a strip of electrical tape over them, but that would kill my ability to effectively cycle profiles and DPI (the cycling pauses briefly when you cycle your DPI, so you can see what setting you're on).  Not cool at all.  I suppose you could keep four batteries and just go through through them and charge them all every 2-5 days, depending on use, but that could be even more of a hassle+expense.

FORM FACTOR:
The one thing I do like is the size and shape of the mouse.  I really love the bumpy, grippy ""eggshell"" finish on the sides...I wish I could get it in a spray can and apply it to various things myself.  Oddly, the G602 has the same texture finish with a slightly rubbery feel.  This one is dry and hard, almost exactly like an eggshell.

CONCLUSION:
I feel like this mouse is far more of a hassle than is warranted, especially for the price point.  I'm a fan of Logitech, so I was a bit surprised and let down.  Logitech has better options for less money in the G600 (wired-insanely customizable) and G602 (wireless-amazing battery life).  Heck, I would take an M510 over the G700.

It takes place, I think, in the future where an alien race has assaulted planet Earth.  Apparently they have the ability to make people into their race, or something.  I don't really know, as the plot is very uninteresting and mostly inconsequential.  You play some guy, a ""Sentinel"", which means something special, but I don't know what.  As you can tell I didn't play the first one, so maybe this is all stuff I should already know.  Regardless, it all seems very generic and super thin on plot.  I have not played in multi-player, as I have no interest.  Apparently this is where the game shines, or so I'm told.  I'll never know because it is unlikely I'll ever put it back in the tray.

The environments are pretty stunning in some places, the graphics pretty good, and the sound very rich.  The gun variety is lacking...  most of the time you will have the same weapon, or whatever weapon you have ammo for.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time you'll be forced to dump weapons in trade for whatever you can find that has ammo.  Apparently this passes as strategy.

There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one ""big boss"" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.

My biggest complaint with the game is that it devolves into ""Serious Sam"" style game play.  You'll, essentially, round the corner to find a gigantic pile of bad guys who want nothing more than to kick-start your face with their massive arsenal of weaponry.  You'll do lots of running in circles trying to track and kill waves of spidery things, packs of flying drones, waves of zombie-like-rip-off things, and big dudes with player-seeking missiles.  It gets old, and in my opinion is the mark of poor level design.  Checkpoint, walk a bit, massive swam of bad guys, checkpoint.

The above mess is a Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince video game experience.  And I know despite what I write, if you're here you will end up playing the game anyway, hoping I'm mistaken.  I will continue if only to persuade you to rent the game at best or wait for the inevitable, monstrous price drop.

To Begin - The Story, Characters, and Sound:
If you needed to write a report on the Half-Blood Prince film, this video game wouldn't even be acceptable as cliff notes.  Scenes cut in and out, not caring about anything silly like making sense.

The video game starts with a random brush up with Quidditch at the Burrow and then bipolars you straight to the scene in Diagon Alley with Draco Malfoy.  Why?  That question should be read as a scream.

And from there you jump from moment to moment like a mental patient, who isn't improving.

As far as the characters in this cliff note of cliff notes, everyone is at least acceptable or great.  Great, as in the case of when the film actors lend their voice (the focus being on Rupert Grint-Ron).  The acceptable being characters like Snape and generally the look of everyone.  There is one huge exception:  Hermione.  The actress who lends her voice is fine, but the rendered character looks nothing like Emma Watson.  She looks more like Mema Witson, and while she's a great girl and all, Mema isn't in Harry Potter.  The real problem is that Harry and Ron look reasonably similar to Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (having gone through the work in the previous game, whereas Emma Watson did not, to my knowledge) so Hermione, aka Mema Witson, stands out.

The music of the games is always either nice or fantastic.  This game favors more toward simply nice, but whoever thought that adding a record scratch to highlight an awkward moment between Harry and Ginny was a good idea; way to stand out, my man.  That was truly A+ dumb.

Well, I'd love to continue with my review, but I need to have a duel.

The Middle, Gameplay?:
The Order of the Phoenix game had 3 things going for it: a beautiful Hogwarts, most of the film actors participated, and the painting that loved Chops and Gravy.  Yum yum yum yum, gravy.  This game?

Duel, quidditch (by which I mean flying through stars), and potions.  Potions, duel, quidditch, punch making?  Duel, potions, duel, quidditch.  That is the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince game.

And while dueling is far more refined here than in previous games, it pops up everywhere, and all you need to do is knock your opponent down once with Expelliarmus (yes, I looked up how to spell a lot of things in this review) and it's game over.  And while potions can be fun, these are side games and side games do not a video game make.  I get the feeling that, oh hold on.  I need to duel again.

As I was saying, if EA would just put itself in a timeout and make a game based on several movies, we'd actually get an inspired gift of a game as opposed to these socks we keep getting.  Or even if they, oh, I don't know, gave a damn?  EA has done a Quidditch game before, so why isn't there at least a full on game here instead of Harry going through stars?  Why can't we control other characters in actual mission, versus doing the same things Harry does (how fun would a thought out Luna side-mission be?).  And whereas Order of the Phoenix was nothing but a list of chores to do, Half-Blood Prince is the same only with your mom running out of patience with you.  GO PRACTICE QUIDDITCH NOW!!!!.

The only beauty comes from a very beautiful source, the character of Luna Lovegood.  As you're lighting fireworks, and trying very hard but unsuccessfully to get a great look at Hogwarts lit by the exploding color wheel, Luna pleads ""I wish fireworks didn't have an end.""

The End:
This game was supposed to be released in November '08, as was the film (damn you Warner Brothers).  But stock market greed from Warner's pushed the due date to June '09.  And what did EA do with that extra time?  Worked on Madden 11?

But that's irrelevant.  To EA, this game was never meant to be anything but a cash grab, and all the extra time + 1 would never have made it any better.  Ever since the Prisoner of Azkaban game, EA's effort with Harry Potter has equaled my effort in personal grooming when I was 12.  Let's say, not so great.  But the films and the books have been about love and bravery and effort.  Where is any of that in these games?  Where is it?

2.0,False,"10 5, 2014",A1OJG6EOL59HGE,B00BQWTGIS,Rynoth,"Cons:

Currency is worthless:
You spend cash to buy parts to craft secondary items, unlock weapons, buy ammo and unlock new cars.
But with your phone you can run passed 5 civilians, hack their bank accounts for $500 to $6000. You get abilities to further increase that so you will regularly steal $13K from a single civilian.

Because of that your character will become unbelievable overpowered VERY early in the game. You should not be able to afford a semi-automatic grenade launcher in your first hour of play. It shouldn't even be available.

Driving is terrible:
Your car is a tank that can absorb a ridiculous amount of punishment. Your tech tree allows to further upgrade the amount of damage it can soak. It also drive like a tank. Poor handling, maneuvering, and just all around bad experience. If you're going to include a GTA style open world experience, you should spent more than 2 months on the driving mechanics.

The Storyline is hilariously bad:
I'm only going to touch on the beginning story that you learn pretty quick. So MINOR SPOILERS.

The story is you were a big shot hacker who was stealing money from people at a hotel. An intrusion was detected and you and your partner were implicated. They sent ""fixers"" after you (the in game equivalent of hitmen) to scare you, which resulted in the death of your niece.

Aiden Pearce clearly hasn't gotten over her death, but from the interactions with your sister and her son he seems to be the only one. They are trying to move on, while Aiden is obsessed with finding the person who ordered the attack, which makes him look crazy. Uni-bomber crazy rather than Batman crazy.
He is also painfully unaware of his own role in her death. Says stupid lines like, ""I'll find the people responsible,"" while I shout at my screen, ""Look in a mirror you selfish self-righteous di ck!""

Going on a one man crusade loose-cannon cop style after the corrupt foreign diplomat (diplomatic immunity be damned) is fine...
As long as your character is in the right. It's really hard to believe in the cause of the protagonist when he regularly steals money from war veterans and cancer patients.

The story would have been amazing as a tale of the dangers of hubris. Aiden stealing money because he could and thought he was too good of a hacker to get caught. Then he gets a karmatic smack down and turns over a new leaf. Instead of going back to the EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR THAT GOT HIS NIECE KILLED IN THE FIRST PLACE!

Multiplayer is terrible:
Watch Dogs gives you the ability to invade the game of another player like Dark Souls. You can race, tail, hack, or even do free roam. Hacking is seriously the worst.

It works like this. You invade someone's game. You both look like random NPC's to each other. The hacker has 5 mins to hack the target's phone. Once hacked, he then has 45 seconds to activate the backdoor program (ie: start the match).

During the match, the hacker finds a place to hide within the AOE of the match area which is marked on your HUD. The closer he gets to completing the hack, the smaller this AOE becomes making it harder to hide. Step out of the AOE pauses the hack. The target's job is to find the hacker and kill him before the hack is complete. If the hacker is spotted by his target, the hack is aborted and he must try to escape or be killed.

Sounds great. Well it blows. Mainly do to the rampant amounts of griefing, glitching, and poor decisions by Ubisoft. You see, during the match the hacker can see the target at all times, even through cars, and walls. So a common strategy used is to hack your target, then go to a train station (which is above ground level) get as high as you can, and just wait until he makes the ascent. Once you see him, you simply drop down and change your elevation and watch him bumble around trying to find you.

I've had instances of hiding on the other side of semis or UPS vans and just inching my way around them as my target searches for me on the other side because I can see him through the vehicle and he can't see me.

The game was so poorly tested that you can use vehicles to get onto roofs that are otherwise inaccessible. So hackers will routinely glitch onto buildings to hide.

I've seen hackers go into parking garages with only garage doors for access, close them, and activate blackout after blackout.
Because garage doors stop working when the power is cut, the target can't get to them. Players can hold 8 blackouts. 4 ready to use, and enough crafting items to create 4 more. At 40 seconds each, that's 5 minutes and 30 seconds that you are PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE of getting to the hacker! It takes only about 2 - 3 minutes for the hacker to hack your phone! Are you f--ing KIDDING me Ubisoft!?

On the flip side, the target can know when his game is invaded before the hacking match starts. Simply pause the game and notice the background doesn't pause, or notices bullet time doesn't work.

If he hacks a special NPC (Blume Affiliate) they will then make a call and put a hit on him. Meaning he knows someone will be in his game soon.

This allows him to prep an area before hand. Hack the Blume Affiliate and wait.
So I've entered games where my target just waits in an open field for me to approach gunning down anything that moves.

I've gone into bars, rigged the place with explosives and waited for my would-be hacker. It's cheap, it's unfair, and it's not fun.

Multiplayer is also terribly synched. To give an example. I was being a troll and rigged a bar. On the outside of the bar was a sports car as bait, all 4 tires shot out, with 2 IED's planted on the bumper. My hacker enters, hacks me, tries to run. I detonate the explosives in the bar one after another. He takes damage but is still alive somehow. He runs out the front, sees the sports car and takes it. I detonate the first bomb, then the second, and nothing. He's alive, his car is still functioning and he escapes.

You put a single explosive on ANY car in single player, get inside and detonate. It will kill Aiden 100% of the time but not an enemy-player in multiplayer.

The escape portion of the hacking mission is also broken. If the hacker gets into a car and drives off, the target has probably 2 seconds or less to find a vehicle of their own to pursue or the hacker will get away. If the hacker is lucky enough to get a sports car and you wind up with a van, you lose automatically. Blowing out the tires does nothing, and the only way to disable vehicles (since drivers can't drive AND shoot) is to try to hack traffic lights or road blocks but that can be easily prevented if he uses a black out, which as I stated before, lasts forever and can't be stopped.

So to put it bluntly. Watch Dogs sucks something fierce, and Ubisoft should feel bad. It's a proof of concept for a game rather than an actual game. All the pieces are there, but executed with the grace and poise of a ballerina with polio.

If you can get the game for $5 then maybe go ahead and give it a try. But do not pay retail and even $30 is comically too much for this over-hyped, horrendous, mess of a game.",It's as bad as the bad reviews or worse,1412467200,16,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",
2.0,True,"06 2, 2012",A4BJHXZLZB9WG,B00178630A,Shanghaied,"I remember the night of May 14th, 2012, and Im telling you about it now because its a good metaphor for the product Im going to discuss shortly.

I was at a local Frys Electronics, standing in a huge line that wrapped around the building.  It was my first midnight opening, and it was an eye opener.  Probably a hundred odd people standing in a line that wrapped around the building, waiting for the ball to drop for a franchise that had been dormant for 12 years.

Ill always remember the people in front of me.  They were a group of overweight, bearded men in worn clothing, T-Shirts tucked in, and. Fanny packs.  Yes, thats right, fanny packs.

The fanny packs do stand out in memory (too well, surprisingly), but thats not the reason I remember these guys; I remember them because of the discussion we had.  They informed me (using heated language that wouldnt be appropriate for this site)  how terrible this game would be, how it was a tragedy to the Blizzard name, and how it was further proof of the downfall of this once great company.

I remember this because I had no idea why these guys were standing in line in front of an electronics retailer waiting patiently for the midnight release of a game that would ultimately be the biggest tragedy in recent video game history.  Well revisit this concept later.

I did understand their argument perfectly however.  An always online requirement, which limits their choice on how to play the game and eliminated 3rd party modding potential (which in light of the heavily flooded servers during the first week I gained intimate appreciation of), no skill trees, a real money auction house that encouraged a pay to win  mechanic, and visuals that were styled in a drastically different manner than previous installments in the series.  And of course, the many conspiracy theories of the time regarding Blizzards denied intentions of making a console version of the game (we all know what happened with those).

----------------------------------------------

On some of these matters I sympathized deeply.  Diablo 2 shouldve been an alarming example of what happens when you design an economy that can be manipulated by external currency or influence.  In that case, it was understandable; D2 was the first big foray into a managed online environment. At that point in online gamings relative infancy it wouldve been impossible to truly foresee just how deeply the most dedicated portion of the community would work to game the system, even in a closed environment. As the community discovered, there really weren't any lengths they wouldnt go to.

So in the case of Diablo 3 theres a very strong argument to be made, in light of this, that Blizzard shouldve known the RMAH would introduce factors they couldn't control.  Their hubris, likely derived from dictating gameplay in titles like Starcraft's knife-edged tuning and World of Warcrafts ongoing and so thoroughly controlled aspects of progression, balance, and player empowerment, are evident in it's inclusion and execution.  Things however must have changed in 12 years, and its got to be easier to control that sort of environment.

They were wrong.  Immediately out of the gate, gold farmers began a campaign to prepare for the launch of the RMAH (some time after launch) and flooded the economy with gold.  Inflation on the gold auction house spiraled out of control, while gold on the Real Money Auction house plummeted in value.  The result?  People who actually wanted to play the game were without enough gold to buy items needed to progress.  Their alternative was to face the RNG God, who in Diablo 3 proved particularly merciless.

You either paid more money for gold, or you scraped by with dull rares that did the job sometimes.  And the stat rolls on many of them would probably have benefited another class more than yours.  So many items dropped, so few worth anything.  And forget selling mediocre off class items on the AH; they were abundant there, and no one was buying.

-----------------------------------------------------------

So why didn't Blizzard just improve the drop rate?  True, that likely wouldve curbed inflation some.  But it wouldve left one thing intact; random drops still aren't as good as getting exactly what you want for cheap.  The AH wouldve still dominated progression.
Add that to the ultra punishing release-state inferno difficulty and varying class balance issues and the game felt like a chore to play in end-game; and no one wanted to at a point. Finishing vanilla inferno was so daunting and so frustratingly difficult that once/if you finished, you took a sigh of relief and went somewhere for a victory drink, and tried to forget Diablo 3.  It was uncharacteristic for the series.

------------------------------------------------------------

Over the course of its 2 year existence, Diablo 3 has changed.  The RMAH is gone.  Loot and its randomness have been redesigned.  Character balance has changed, and the overall difficulty of the game can be adjusted to better suit the player.  Most would argue this has all been to great effect.

But remember our fanny packed friends, and remember that first impressions really do matter.  In many respects, their sentiments were correct and as convenient as hindsight is now, I believe they weren't totally wrong.  Diablo 3 missed the mark in many ways and introduced many frustrating aspects that drew players away from the most important thing; actually playing the game.

And yet, when you did play, and your character had a build you liked and could survive long enough to battle, it was glorious.  I would argue that if this game did one thing right above anything and anyone else it was how nearly perfect the gameplay was; to send your character into the foray against hundreds of demons and watch them smash them all to literal pieces; to revel in the way passive and active skills synergized to empower each other; to listen to your character taunt the hordes after a single blow levels an entire pack.  These things shouldve been the focus; the core of what this game shouldve been; and everything else we've mentioned now should've served to accentuate it, not mire it as a near afterthought.

It took me 2 years, but I realize now why my fanny packed friends, who seemed to so desperately hate this game, were standing with me on May 14th at 11:45 PM.  It was because they probably love this game several times more than I do.",Diablo 3: A Requiem,1338595200,2,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I love this TV series, and I also have enjoyed previous Law & Order games. I thought this would be a perfect match for me and my interests, and in fact I made plans to do a full walkthrough for the game.

If I hadn't made those plans, I wouldn't have lasted more than 15 minutes in this game. As it is, I still haven't finished my walkthrough because the game is so incredibly frustrating. I'm playing the game on a very robust system that I have played *hundreds* of other games on to write up reviews. It is most definitely not a machine issue here - it is a game issue.

The premise is that you are in essence doing the things in the TV series. This means there is no courthouse scenes, like in Law & Order (the original). In Criminal Intent, the show is all about understanding the criminal mind, figuring out what happened and getting them to confess.

First, character movement is awful. Your character gets stuck on doors, stuck on walls, stuck on other people, and just stands there twitching like a madman. You have to keep moving around until you can get him in the exact right spot to interact with the object you wish. Sometimes he'll randomly throw his arms straight out in a ""I can fly!!"" movement.

The game crashes. Often. Save every 5 minutes if you don't want to lose your data.

The map menu buttons sometimes become disabled. You lose the ability to scroll up or down. This gets you stuck on half the map area for a while. In addition, there's a strange diagonal-arrow button on the map that, when you press it, reveals hidden areas that you shouldn't know about yet. Since there is no warning that this is some sort of a cheat, it affects your gameplay.

There's a new interrogation mode where instead of choosing specific things to ask, you instead choose a ""style of speaking"" - for example you can be straightforward, or empathtic, or flattering, or so on. This is nice in theory. In practice it is AWFUL. There are times that you choose empathetic and the character says something REALLY cruel. You just watch it like a train wreck with your mouth wide open. At least, if you screw up, all you have to do is walk away for a few minutes and then return again. The person seems to have completely forgotten how much you upset them. Also, there are times that asking a question makes the person respond in a way that makes no sense. The game sort of expects you to use a certain order and if you happen to choose a different order, the game doesn't account for it. For example, in one situation you ask a question in one way and the person lies. So then you press them on the question saying ""why did you lie?"" If you choose to just press them in the first place, you still say ""why did you lie?"" even though the person didn't lie at all.

Certainly there were good intentions here. The graphics are reasonably good. The gameplay theory is good.

2.0,False,"04 15, 2016",A3SD57HI8TYFFZ,B00P9QGNEM,K. Stuart,"This game has a lot of problems. For one, it's a documentary pretending to be a video game, leaving most of the game aspects subpar at best. Controls are sluggish and glitchy, often resulting in the main character getting stuck midair or falling to her death after sliding off of a cliff due to the delay between commanding her to jump and her actually jumping. Other issues include poor camera management that occasionally leaves one character off screen and inconsistent mechanics such as allowing water to kill you in most levels except one. Lastly, controlling the Bola is a huge pain and pretty much impossible to use with any real accuracy.

Most of the puzzles consist merely of jumping from one ledge to another. I'd say there are less than 5 actual puzzles (i.e. consisting of more than just platforming) in the entire game, summing to less than 20 minutes of play time. These puzzles were enjoyable, but you do spend an awful lot of time simply walking and jumping from left to right.

The cultural insights to the Alaskan natives are very well presented and you're pretty much guaranteed to unlock all 24 of them as you play through the game. I think only 2 of them are missable. Watching these videos as they unlock is necessary in order to understand the content of each level (such as why the northern lights want to hug you to death or why midget natives live underground), yet some of the videos also spoil upcoming game content in the levels. So you lose out on the gaming aspects if you watch the videos but you lose out on understanding the setting if you don't. This makes for a lose-lose situation either way.

The game itself directly follows a story told by the Alaskan natives, and I'd say each level fits very well with the narration. The story isn't spectacular, but at least it adds some meaning to your otherwise suicidal wandering through the blizzard. There's only one thing about the story I didn't understand: how does chipping an axe have anything to do with caribou feet? This is a rather strange ending to an otherwise interesting fable about the cause of a blizzard.

If you choose to purchase Never Alone: Foxtales, you will have the opportunity to play through another story told by the Alaskan natives.  As with the main game, this is another (albeit shorter) documentary disguised as a video game.  Unfortunately, this DLC features even worse controls and even worse mechanic inconsistencies than the main game.  Controls maintain their sluggish feeling present in Never Alone and now add control for paddling a boat that couldn't possibly be any worse.  Thrown rocks break when they hit the ground unless the puzzle specifically requires them to hit the ground.  Water now doesn't seem to kill you except for in two or three sections which doesn't seem to make any sense.

The puzzles are far better in Foxtales than in Never Alone, showing off some actual creativity in design and making for a game that is not comprised solely of jumping left to right on moving platforms; however, the puzzles only feature two mechanics in the entire game--fox moves the water currents and Nuna throws rocks--so plan on repeating that a lot.  The final puzzle requires precision and timing, which is quite miserable given the control issues.  About 75% of this game does leave you doing nothing more than paddling a boat, so as with Never Alone you're still basically just moving left to right but now you have the occasional interruption of a puzzle.

The five Insight videos in Foxtales are much less insightful and interesting than in Never Alone.  As indicated by the first Insight video, the game developers thought this story about a giant mouse and respect for animals would make a good game expansion, so they threw a game together without really thinking about the Insight videos that should accompany the game.

I can't help but to conclude the same thing for both Never Alone and Foxtales: these are absolutely gorgeous games featuring a well-produced documentary wrapped up inside a boring and inconsistent platformer.  Foxtales has better puzzles than Never Alone, but they're accompanied by worse videos.  In either case, unlocking the documentary will require playing through a game that fails to offer any real enjoyment or creativity in level design.","Decent documentary, boring game",1460678400,,,

Titanfall is the best looking One game I have.  The first one that looks crisp and clean.  The controls work great on the game.  I never have a problem moving around or doing whatever it is that I need to do.

Now that I have Live, I decided to rent it again since almost all critics seem to praise this title as the best Live game available. I can honestly say that these folks have never played anyother Live game such as Ghost Recon or Unreal Championship!!! Though online is better, it does suffer from the same aspects as the single player mode, it is way to hard to destroy mechs. It is a good idea to play through the single player campaign to unlock the stronger mechs and so you can see the stats of other mechs available, but it will end up being more of a stuggle than fun. Also, the enemy can always hear what you say on Live, which elliminates a large amount of potential strategy, but does allow for stronger communication to others. You can press a button to talk only to teammates, but very few bother with this.
This game isn't compltely bad though, playing mutiplayer and watching 8 mechs explode in your face is quite entertaining. And there is alot of potential to this title. Some improvements I'd like to see in MechAssault2 would be 1st person perspective (sense of size would be better), a health bar over opponents so you can see how much life they have left, midlevel saves, and voice chat switched so you always talk to your team and have to press a button to talk to enemies.

Let me assure you that it looks far better than it plays.  Any positive that the gravity-tweaking stuff might provide is offset by the terrible gun action and impotent cover system.

Inversion is basically a series of very small-area high stress combat scenarios that you often have to play through several times before you find ""the clean line"" to complete it.  Between every little area is a cinematic of some sort, and in most cases it is over-acted, under-written garbage.  The main character's quest for his daughter is just jibberish.  The game is trying to be plot heavy but the plot is very cliche and boring.  I'm five chapters in and have spent as much time watching nonsense than playing the actual game.

The graphics and environments are outstanding.  The level design is very creative.  The vistas are impressive, the art is fantastic.

It is too bad that the game plays, on a technical level, like an amateur cut-rate attempt at Gears of War.  The cover system might as well be from the Perfect Dark era.  You'll often not stick to cover but dodge/roll into the open.  You'll find that stuff that looks like it should be cover, isn't.  You'll find popping up out of cover to shoot doesn't follow where you are looking, which can make it very difficult to target quickly.  You are always looking over the character's right shoulder, so when he comes out of cover on the left side, he steps wide left -- but when he comes out of cover on the right, he comes out just a bit.  That can make predicting shot angles difficult.  The game definitely tries to force you to use the poorly-executed cover system by inflicting you with overwhelming odds, either by sheer number or by brute force.  The game just doesn't provide a smooth experience -- you'll find yourself spending more time fighting the game than fighting IN the game.

In the beginning of the game you get a taste of much of the gravity powers.  I'm five chapters in and I can only do really one thing, and it really isn't that interesting.

The boss battles I have encountered are frustrating, and without explanation.  Like some of the other combat experiences, you basically just have to plod your way through it, dying repeatedly, until you figure out what to do -- then play it clean.  A poor choice in gameplay dynamic, which also shows a lack of creativity on the developers part.  Once again, good art -- bad gameplay.

I know many people get bent out of shape at reviews from people who haven't completed the game.  I very seriously doubt I will bother to play much further.  This piece of garbage game belongs as a rental.  If you really must purchase it, please try it as a rental first.

Game play is basically the same as in the first Ben 10 game, you unlock more aliens and moves as you progress through the story line. This game has a more 3d look that the first Ben 10 game that had more of a cartoon feel.

Pros:
-The ability to attack by moving and waving the wiimote and nunchuck is great for younger kids who won't be able to do the button combinations for all the moves.
-Actual voices from the show, lots of video scenes to watch
-Ben 10 fans (kids) probably won't notice the huge game play issues.

Cons:
-The biggest problem is that the game is just horribly buggy. Especially in 2 player mode.  Camera tracking is bad, interaction between objects is poor (can fall through floors, float in the air on nothing, die and come back over open pits and just die in a loop) When my son and I play I will join in to get past some harder areas and with the bugs in game play you simply can't complete the game in 2 player mode all the way through.

You play as Nathan Drake, as The Rocketeer. No, wait; you're Will, my mistake. It's so easy to confuse the two (damn you Nolan North. How about taking a little break before over exposure gets us all Northed out). The story takes place in the ever popular, rarely ever used in video games, World War II era. But there is a twist. You get sucked into the Bermuda Triangle and get thrown into another dimension where there is a war going on between the Survivors, humans who have gotten there the same way you have, and the Watchers, a sort of alien/robot species that once ruled over humans and who are trying to get back into the regular dimension to take control and enslave humanity once more.

And that's about where I lost track of everything.

Somewhere between bad story telling, mediocre third person shooter gameplay, and trying to not fall off cliffs and ledges to my death, I was starting to lose interest really fast. It's as if they wanted the gameplay to tell the story for them so they didn't bother introducing characters or explaining who and what. This is fine. But not when what you're doing is boring and slowly paced. That is, until you reach the later parts of the second half of the game. That's when someone pushes the Ludicrous Speed button and passes by the stuff that you were actually wanting to know.

So why did I keep playing? Simple. I'm a sucker for flying. I love flying in games. That coupled with my love for the 1991 Disney movie The Rocketeer, Dark Void had an unfair grip on my jetpack ignition. Don't get it twisted, the flying is not the greatest, but if you need a fix and want to do some air combat then this will tie you over. They had some neat ideas when trying to put this game together, it's just too bad they were poorly executed. Like hijacking a UFO, which sounds like fun doesn't it? Well it was the first time. But doing it's drawn out button pressing over and over isn't exactly a good time. And then there's the ""which way is up? Oh, never mind, I just found this nice hard wall"" problem that kept popping up for me. If that wasn't when I was trying to follow something in the air, it was the kickback from initially turning the jetpack on where I'd go shooting off flailing in the air for a few seconds before I rocketed head first into a wall. Apart from a few annoyances, I can't complain about this aspect of the game because it is what I was looking forward to the whole time. I guess you can say I had fun with it. Sadly, those flying levels took up about 35%-40% of the game itself.

The rest of the game you were on foot shooting different colored robots. This gameplay is what made me grow weary. It was playable, but there just didn't feel like there was any depth to it. And then you had this weird vertical cover system. Where you would rocket up to a ledge, and hang underneath it but not like you would think. You're crouched behind a vertical ledge in a very uncomfortable and unnatural looking position especially for someone with a jetpack on their back. And if you think that would mess with your head and cause you to go a little dizzy, trust me, you are spot on.

In the end, it's hard to say go out and play this game. Because I for one would be happy never touching it again. Sadly, the ending leaves it wide open for a sequel. It's too bad you'll be left wondering what the hell just happened when the game ends, leaving that want and need for a sequel nowhere to be found. The story felt very slow and then very rushed with no happy medium. And the only part of it all that's enjoyable is a small percentage of the game as a whole. When it was over the smile on my face was priceless, because I knew that I can finally toss Dark Void into itself. (Get it? A dark v... nevermind.)

- Simplifies the game down to the bare-bones of what makes an RPG an RPG. The companions, storyline, spells, equipment, and quests have been dumbed down to a point that is almost insulting.

- Ignores the original DA almost completely.

- Feels cheap, rushed and unfinished. There are very few moments in the game that make you think ""Wow, this is the reason I love Bioware!"" The sweeping worlds, memorable characters and epic quests that were found in their past games remain there, as they are no where to be found in Dragon Age II.

- Combat has been reworked to flow very quickly, where the focus is more on slaying enemies en masse instead of more thought out, tactical style that is found in most RPGs. Area of Effect spells only have friendly-fire when playing on the hardest difficulty so if you want to launch a fireball at your warrior, go for it.

- No interest in the outcome since there is no real storyline. You are ushered from one quest to another but they all feel pretty interchangeable and weak. Very little exploration or locations make the constant repetition of maps painfully apparent.

In Windows 98 it drops to desktop frequently, some Sims become completely unusable as certain crashes happen at the same spot for that Sim every time.  You could lose your entire family if you have 98 and use this expansion.
Under XP it doesn't crash but there are still nagging problems:
- the 'superfast' clock speed, the one that pops up automatically and you cannot go to yourself, frequently stops in mid-day or mid-night for no reason.
- Water leaks under toilets and tubs and cannot be cleaned up by the Sims (though the maid gets it).
- The movement AI was never good, but now it's even worse than before.
- Neighborhood stray pets are a nuisance, especially skunks and el bandito (racoon), though I've had fewer burglars so they may merely replace burglars.
- Sims seem to need substantially more sleep than before.  I had a steady schedule for my family, and now I have lost an hour or so due to new, higher sleep requirements.

2.0,False,"11 12, 2006",A2V8XFPYX8UUI0,B000HKGIOA,Papa Miguel,"My introduction to FEAR was via the Xbox 360 demo downloadable from Xbox Live. The demo was fairly solid and since I had heard so much about this game from different online and magazine ratings I decided I was pretty safe to buy it. I figured that my demo experience was only a taste and that I was in for a real treat. Unfortunately, this game has not impressed me. If you download the Xbox 360 demo basically you are getting the entire game. That's no exaggeration. The gameplay turned out to be ridiculously repetitive and almost all the weapons available in the game are represented in the demo. Here's a breakdown of why I rated this game so poorly.

GOOD:

Graphics - For the most part they are amazing. One only needs look at some of the screenshots posted online. They didn't do too well on faces: they look like plastic dolls, but everything else is stellar.

MEDIOCRE:

Gameplay - Gameplay was OK. An element that has been incorporated before but is still pretty interesting is a slow motion button. The slow mo even recharges after a while. The enemy AI is pretty good, also. FEAR doesn't really bring anything that new and exciting in terms of gameplay, though. Nothing new in terms of weapons, maneuvers, or overall gameplay. There are no open environments like in Halo or Half Life 2 and there are definitely no vehicles.

BAD:

Repetition - This is the number one offense of this game and it should be underscored more than anything else. I would say that if you play the Xbox Live demo over and over for about 10 hours you'll probably have the same level of enjoyment. I was astounded at how lacking this game was in terms of originality. You leave one room only to enter another to go the exact same thing again. Even the creepy scenes get repetitious and my own horror soon evolved into numbness.

Storyline - For me, personally, this was a really stupid and overused storyline. I won't spoil it for anyone, but if you're a sci fi horror fan you can rest assured that this one has been played out a bit too much.

Sound - No music, period. Only ambient sounds. In addition, at least the Xbox 360 version of this game has some weird sound dynamics. Even with the in-game menu speech volume turned all the way up I had to turn up the volume on my TV full blast whenever anyone spoke so I could hear them.

Profanity - although this doesn't affect too many who play rated M games it should be mentioned for those who are concerned. The F word is prolific and I mean really, really prolific.

My recommendation to anyone thinking of purchasing this is to rent it first. I think it is a good rental game since you can probably get through it all in a rental period.","Save your money, rent it first before you buy into the hype",1163289600,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

From the dreadlocked bratty-mouthed cyberdouche main character to the horrid gun system to the boring enemies this game is just plain old NOT FUN.

The world is set up strangely. You have these big open cityscapes to explore, and the exploration would be 10 times funner if not for the random stupid radiation clouds which kill you pretty quickly and the ridiculous water pools which you cannot escape. Why even bother putting an oxygen meter in the game when you can't get out of the water anyway? You fall in water = you die. I think I only grappled myself out once. So half the game is outside in the city, but the other half is inside buildings. This is achieved with the most boring repetitive design ever. Big square hallways and big square staircases that all look identical.

I don't understand why they even put an ""aim"" function for the guns because all it does is take your field of view from ""super wide"" to ""pretty wide"".

I'm an active gamer with xbox 360 and I have never had a problem with any game like I did this one. It's not the base game, its the downloadable content that comes with the disc 2 ""content disc."" It took me 6 times to get it to install properly, I finally went online and found that in order to get it to install, you are not supposed to have any other dlc installed for this title (which there is tons of and a lot of it is now free so I downloaded it all) so I deleted it all and then installed the disc and had no problem.

2.0,False,"12 2, 2012",A1SOCFDNJ10U6B,B0079NGSDO,Brandon J. Gray,"Pros:

* Combat system was fun to use, although I did run into difficulty using enemies as human shields. It would not always work as it should which was incredibly frustrating.
* Town graphics / rendering were upgraded from previous versions
* It's Assassin's Creed
* Connor is a bada$$ when the combat system is working properly and that is fun to see and do.
* Desmond's missions. Awesome. Finally got to see him in live action on missions which was great.
* Weather. The added rain affects were awesome. Wish these could've existed in Italy with some of those scenes -- would've looked great.
* Climbing animation was significantly upgraded which was great!
* They developed the game in DX11 for the PC. Very happy to see them utilize the vastly superior PC hardware instead of just direct-porting the inferior console version to PC as they have in the past. I have played the game on XBOX as well, and it is no comparison. To use a common car comparison -- playing this game on the XBOX compared to the PC is like driving a Ford Taurus (XBOX) compared to a Corvette (PC).
* ""Tomb Missions"". These are now replaced with what are called ""Captain Kidd"" missions. It is basically a mystery you are trying to solve which is actually pretty cool. You get some great visuals in these missions that look AWESOME on the PC in DX11.
* Naval Missions. As part of your Assassin career, you also Captain ""The Aquila"", a warship you revive during the game and go out and perform various tasks (rescues, escorts, attacks, etc.). These missions are pretty fun.

Cons:

* Music. The Music is a significant downgrade from games like AC2 / ACB. The magic the music created in those games is non-existent in this one.
* Story. Very scattered and inconsistent story plot. Also the story overall was way too....sad. At every turn you're being betrayed, having family members / friends killed or being forced to kill them yourself. Bad ending both for Connor and for Desmond. Very anti-climactic. I hate the direction they are going with the series as far as the storyline. Also the way the start of each sequence forces you into a cutscene absolutely kills the chronology of the side missions and when they should be completed. Need a far better tie-in. Should have had the primary sequences just be placed on the map so you could start the next sequence when ready as far as the main storyline and have a chance to complete side missions before seeing an urgent cut scene that made you feel like you had to rush off to finish the primary story.
* Connor's personality. They made him into a robot. He has very little emotional development throughout the game. Some people say he seems ""dumb"". I don't want to say that, but he definitely has no personality, making it tough to get attached to him the way we did with Ezio.
* Hunting / Frontier: Waste of development time. Added nothing in my opinion.
* Mission Design. There were a number of missions that were just AWFUL as far as how they were designed. You had to perform certain tasks in a very precise manner or you would desynchronize. The other AC games provided freedom in how you wanted to complete a mission, and that's something this game missed in many instances.
* Side Quests. I miss the Courtesan, Thief, and Assassination contracts from previous games. This game had pathetic Assassination contracts (I mean really, there is literally zero backstory to them to tie in to the game), and the Liberation missions were only mediocre at best.
* Limited relationships. Connor is 27 by the time the game ends and has no female counterpart. This sort of ties in to the ""robot"" reference I made before. No guy is 27 and has zero romantic interest. Another part of the Ezio storyline that was badly missed here.
* The ending. Both Desmond & Connor's endings are so anticlimactic. As a Desmond fan, I *hate* how they have chosen to ""close"" his storyline. I don't want to give away the specifics, so I'll leave it at that. Connor's ending is also very open-ended, and so far, I'm just not attached to him at all as a character -- I am really hoping they can do a better job of developing his personality in future games, because he doesn't have one currently.

Other Thoughts:

Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with the game. Given how much it was super-hyped leading up to its release, it's been pretty mixed in terms of overall reception from the fanbase. AC is an absolutely epic game series. In 30 years of gaming, it is probably #1 or #2 on my list of best game-series. I really hope the crew that did AC2 and ACB are recalled to work on future games because those guys and gals just ""got it"" and knew how to make a magical game. Really hoping we head to France next for the French Revolution. The backstory has been created with Lafayette meeting Connor.

You might be wondering why I gave it 2/5 eggs since I still had a good list of pros. The ending of the game is so epically bad (Desmond specifically) along with how bad the storyline flows that it's just not a good game. There are also numerous bugs in the game that should have easily been fixed before release. My hope is that the next game (the DLC is on its way, maybe it will help also) will reinvigorate the series without destroying everything that it has been able to stand for thus far because this series is frickin awesome overall.

Performance -- I've read that ATI / AMD video cards are having performance problems with the game currently. Given that I'm running a GTX 680 and NVidia released a beta driver a few days before AC3's release, I have had flawless game performance, so for you ATI guys, I'm hopeful they will release a hotfix / beta driver for you shortly so you can play the game. Performance for me was great though -- 1920x1200 with every setting maxed out with the exception of antialiasing, which I dialed down a bit.

It isn't the worst game I ever played, but it has the same game play problems that have plagued this series from the beginning.

I can't wait to buy this game for $5 on steam with hopefully all DLC included so I can get a more complete leveling experience than all of you guys who dished out more than $60 on collectors editions. Hope you guys like 8-15 hour story campaigns for a ""huge"" game world where it obviously was a set up for BUY THE SEASON/EXPANSION PASS TO GET MORE OUT OF IT. Hope you like grinding in the same locations you previously encountered as before with Dinkglage Bot. Since Bungie screwed up on this end, can we just do PVP to level up? It'll be vastly unbalanced, but you'll get more of a rush that way. Boy do I hate myself for saying that too.  The linear progression of this story makes post-launch  Act II of Diablo III on inferno difficulty amazing.

I keep reading these arguments for this where somebody states ""you wouldn't judge World of Warcraft like this as soon as it was released, would you? It was't as compl--"" (insert a sound of my hand slap to that person's face)

OF COURSE I WOULD! BUT AT THE TIME, THERE WAS MORE CONTENT INSIDE OF WOW TO KEEP PEOPLE BUSY BEFORE THE FIRST MAJOR PVP UPDATE BACK IN 2004! When you installed WOW on your machine you had a huge MMO world that wasn't boxed in as this. Excited about exploring the game world? Well, then I hope you like Battlefield 3 style ""do-not-go-further-than-this"" zones.
Ready for countless hours of level grinding in the strangest endgame section ever created? Ready to raise a Light rating to finish your level cap.. instead of..you know, leveling up more the traditional way?
Ready to beat the base story quickly to replay the same content your drudged through with Dinklebot? I mentioned that already but like this game, repetition is never a good thing and this game has PLENTY to go around! Weee!
Ready to still not freaking understand what the heck is going on, even after the level cap concludes? And then wonder why didn't they put said feature or event inside of the actual game!
Ready for non existent social features with other players like not being able to trade or mail items you can't use and...kicking a ball in the tower....wooo.
THEN! Get ready for the most ridiculous RNG loot system to grace a game where grinding and repition is dominant over varying content. This makes crafting in post launch Diablo III look like....Diablo II! Repetition? Of course! This is Bungie's new IP!
Alrighty, then Destiny is your IKEA of a ""next-gen"" MMO. It'll get better after you pay more for it I assure you. And the only reason you are still playing it is because this is what you have for $60-$100. You are stuck with it because you want to try to get your money's worth (insert sobbing denial noise). It'll get better, it must get better, yes, it must.

So what did Bungie get right after the very lackluster character creation that makes EQ1 have amazing options? It plays like Halo...if you love that. I mean it seriously feels like you are playing Halo so when you pick up the controller you will immediately feel at home. It's very smooth and feels great. Of course that can also mean very sluggish compared to players how are used to Counter-Strike or Call of Duty 4. Vehicles are essentially fun to travel around on but are already limiting. The music is amazing, almost personifying the ""excitement"" level more than the actual gameplay or enemy encounters. It has beautiful skyboxes and character models and yaddy yadda yadda.

  The first disadvantage is when you first start the game.  A long ctscene plays, and every two to three seconds, the screen flashes white, which causes splitting headaches for people with eye problems.
  You also must use a keyboard to play, which is extremely difficult; I can't even get out of Hobbiton without falling off a bridge.  The game doesn't support gamepads (special controllers that you can plug in to your computer to play a game), and if it had, the gaming experience would be easier.

I'll keep this short but informative. The fancy looking housing of the mouse is made of weak plastic. Period.

This game fancies itself as some kind of a perfect cross between a sim and an arcade racer, but the truth is that it totally fails to accomplish this goal.  It seems that being stuck in the middle ground isn't doing this new NFS installment any favors and let me explain why.  Individuals who like arcadish racing games will find this title a bit too difficult for their taste, since some sort of driving physics, albeit exaggerated and inaccurate, still exists and the car is not exactly easy to control.  Hardcore sim fans will be thoroughly disappointed as this game is just really not much of a driving simulator at all; physics does not feel realistic, speed feels artificially exaggerated to"" enhance the action experience"", finally, besides top speed and acceleration, cars do not feel all that much different from one another. Overall, the physics of this game does not even come close in comparison to something like GT5 prologue.

If all this wasn't enough, there is the graphics, which really does not seem all that sharp, as it appears to have been tuned down to prevent frame rate issues.  Furthermore, the gameplay was not very impressive at all, as it is an extremely linear progression, which does not allow much freedom whatsoever. Last, but certainly not least, there are compatibility problems with Logitech G25 steering wheel. The wheel feels off-center with a huge center deadzone (I tried playing with the options and didn't help) and finally the force feedback is all messed up - all this adding up to a pretty terrible driving experience with otherwise the best steering wheel on the market.

Overall, this game is stuck in a non-sim/non-arcade land, which really makes it hard to be appealing for fans of either genre.  In certain ways it is similar to GRID, but does not have the same impressive graphics, innovative features and crash sequences and so in other words, it brings nothing new to the table.  The final nail in the coffin is delivered through its sloppy integration with the Logitech G25 steering wheel, which turns a pretty crappy racing experience into a truly horrid one.",Did not like this game,1253059200,70,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1. If you want nostalgic effect, go ahead and play this game. You may like it because of your bias.

2. Final Fantasy V did a better job of AP distribution. Although what makes FF VI good is that you keep whatever you learn in terms of spells, you can only use summons once per battle (when they aren't even that helpful), magic is easily better than weapons, and only a few characters will have a high enough magic stat to make it worthwhile.

3. I played this hearing that is was better than FFVII (which people say is overrated; I've played it and to be honest, it was my first FF game, but even after playing most other FF games, I still think it's the best), I decided to buy it and play it. If you are a completionist in terms of game series, then it'd be a good experience. I am one of those people, and this game was really disappointing. I was expecting much more than FFVII quality than this, and I got less.

4. Character development sucked. People say it's good because there are a ton of characters and each character is defined, but I want quality of quantity. You couldn't grow on a character since they weren't built upon very much.

The only good thing I can say about this game is that this FF sports probably the GREATEST villain of ANY game I've played; he actually SUCCEEDS and is the most cold-hearted character to meet. I really only enjoyed this game whenever HE was around (or IT).

Even the little one shot gee fades will block your path until you dash into them. There is a good mechanic. And then there is a good mechanic that is over-used. And then there is this!!

The game is HARD. They may seem like a good thing for some. But... It's not hard as in difficult, it's hard as in requires muscle memory.

Well i kept my Elite had the extra money so i decided to get this and try it out to see if i wanted to sell my Elite to my lil nephew who wants and Xbox. Plugged it in started downloading my online games, froze up around 90% on Trials HD. I proceeded to hit all the buttons on the controller(which had a lose piece of something making noise on the inside of it), went up hit the button to shut it down, nothing, so i unplugged it back in. Felt the system it was blazing(note:i have a totally open entertainment system with my HD TV, PS3, etc. not a thing closed in. Upon plugging the system back in the power pack was also extremely hot, then guess what? You guessed it, red light came on, and no power no nothing for the whole system. I'v seen some things about the system having the red light when you power up the system but it wouldnt even beep to turn on, NOTHING!. I work on computers for a living and am stunned that something straight out of the box could fry so quickly. My thought is that the brick itself isn't running enough power, or the +/- going  through the system power supply is blowing out, for what reason? I have no clue. The only other thing i know is with all the new system ventilation your more likely to get extreme Static Discharge on your unit, so definitely do not set it on any kind of plush carpet or touch it if you feel a slight bit of static shock on anything around it.  Thats really the only thing i can think of at the moment that could be the issue, i don't bother with tech support i just took it back and they gave me a full refund. They said usually they don't but they were actually expecting problems, so they are making exceptions. Good thing i didn't trade my Elite, i've had 0 problems with it from day one. Love xbox but i guess there are still touchy issues, which is expected with a new system. Also have a PS3 0 problems, so i think its just luck of the draw here. All the computer issues i see with dust, cat hair, ever pure dirt clocking up ventilation, power supplies, fans etc. it seems electronics just aren't made like they use to be. 35 year old man here, so no kids i'm not your fan boy dork, or some TROLL teen as the kids say.

UPDATE:I'd like to add that,  If your old enough to remember, nintendos(original) and ataris, they took so much beating and lasted forever. Also stereos, even older computers took a LOT more abuse and lasted a long long time as well. Technology is becoming a very advanced process, much different from the old days, more power, more speed, and a more vast array of visuals are just stunning the world now, so it stands to reason the new stuff has trouble. Also your packing the power of a large desktop computer into a small compact unit, so yes there will be heat, and other issues as well with so much in something so small. Just like laptops will never beat a desktop for gaming, same reason, size, and they have the same issues.

2.0,False,"08 15, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005OLWB,Tsanche,"REVIEWERS NOTE: Throughout this review the product is referred to as Dragon Quest VII and not Dragon Warrior VII.  They're both the same game, but the truth is: the series is called Dragon Quest.  So don't get confused.  I also refer to the other games in the series as Dragon Quest and not Dragon Warrior.

Dragon Quest is huge in Japan.  The games actually have to be release on Sundays or Holidays because of how big they are.  The Dragon Quest games are not nearly as big in America.  The other Dragon Quest games are actually a real treat--particularly the SNES games that never made it to the states.  Dragon Quest VII does not hit the height of the NES and SNES games in any way shape or form, mainly because this game in particularly, does nothing to actually make the Dragon Quest games mature, and that's really sad.  It's great that they got it together for Dragon Quest VIII, but it can't stop the seventh in the series from being the black sheep of them all.

It's really sad to because of all the Dragon Quest games, the seventh installment is one of the only ones to have a satisfying storyline where things actually progress and you don't spend a lot of time running around so lost you don't know what to do.  It's not a deep story by any means, but it does have more focus here than other Dragon Quest games.  Because of the structure of the story, there's not too much you can explore from the get go, and thus you're limited.

The first thing about Dragon Quest VII that people will note is that the game looks absolutely horrible.  For a late generation PSX game going up against the likes of Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX at the time, this game looks like a rejected Super Nintendo game, and it may be because it was originally in development for that particularly system.  The towns look really bad, the textures are mostly pixelated, the character sprites look horrendous.  Simply put, this is just a terrible looking game.  The sound effects are even worse.  You'll dread each time you have to pick up a barrel and toss it.  You'll dread opening a door.  The games framerate isn't even steady.  The only thing to the games graphical credit is that some of the enemies don't look so bad, and that it's colorful.  Still, even for those who don't base their judgment of a game on graphics will have to take a moment to get used to just how terrible they really are.

The second annoying thing is the menu system.  It's the exact same one that was used in Dragon Quest VI, and it's just a pain to navigate.  In a world where games like Final Fantasy VII made navigating the menu as easy chewing food, Dragon Quest VII makes it a tedious task.  Characters are limited to what they can hold and I don't want to go into the nightmare of equipping and re-equipping characters over and over again.  The menu interface is absolutely horrible.  It seems like such a dumb thing to complain about, but in an RPG released on the Playstation, inventory management shouldn't be so difficult, nor should I have to spend more time in the menu than actually exploring a dungeon.

Combat is also a big problem.  It's not that battling isn't fun.  Firstly, you don't get into a battle for quite some time.  In fact, you'll spend the first couple of hours of the game roaming around not battling anything.  It'll be a miracle if some gamers can even hold out that long.  Especially because it's an RPG with little story exposition in the beginning.  When you do make it to that point though, you'll be met with mixed feelings.  For some odd reason battling is fun, but again, the graphics really make you wonder sometimes.  The battle system is essentially the same as it was on the NES and SNES.  The problem here is simple: This isn't either of the two systems.  I don't mind the combat being menu based, but the fact that you don't see your characters and that they don't physically go up and strike the enemy makes battling feel a little... empty and uninspired.  Some of the enemies actually look pretty good, but I'm bothered that the battle engine is exactly the same as Dragon Quest I from way back when.  Dragon Quest VIII certainly did a far better job in at least making their battles look good.  Here, you just feel as if you're not involved enough.  It's simple, and it is fun because the combat is surprisingly deep and strategic.  Even better the game is a challenge.  But all the while you can't help but thinking you're playing an NES game on a system that is capable of so much more.

They say it'll take you about 100 hours to plow through Dragon Quest VII.  The game is, in fact, huge.  There's tons of sidequests, and just when you think the game is getting stale, they do manage to throw something else at you that gets a little more involved in the gameplay.  The job system, for instance, comes along hours after you've begun your quest, but it adds a lot of variety when it's finally added in there.  Enough to keep you busy for hours.  What a lot of people don't mention about Dragon Quest VII, however, is that a lot of those 100 hours are spent on heavily raising your party to getting better levels and stats.  Dragon Quest is known for making gamers work, and Dragon Quest VII actually does that.  For example, the game will not let you overpower your characters job classes.  There's a point where they do cut you off and you have to advance forward.  However, you've still go to worry about their normal levels, and you don't gain a whole lot of experience or gold from these monsters.  Thus, of the 100 spent to plow through the game, you'll more than likely spend more than 50 hours just leveling up to take on the next challenge.  And Dragon Quest VII is not an easy game.

While the sound effects are bad, the music of the game itself is quite good.  Dragon Quest has always had good music and Dragon Quest VII is no exception.  The game falls short in almost every category except music.  Here's where the game truly shines, and not only that but Dragon Quest fans will recognize some fantastic tunes from other games.

The bottom line is simple.  Is Dragon Quest VII a good game?  The answer is surprisingly, yes.  You just have to really be able to get passed the fact that you're playing an NES game on a system capable of so much more.  Simplicity has kept the series alive at least, but the game seriously looks like a rejected SNES title that they felt they needed to dress up in tattered clothes and shove onto the Playstation.  The game isn't bad, it's just that by the time Dragon Quest reached the seventh installment, one has to wonder why the developers didn't actually make it look or play like a Playstation RPG.

If you can look past the NES appeal, Dragon Quest VII is a great game.  It's fun to battle in (despite it's graphics).  There are tons of mini-games and sidequests to do, and there's so much variety that you'll want to play just for the sheer fact that you KNOW you haven't uncovered anything.  Still, the old school nature of this game is going to be hard to swallow, even for old school gamers.  The game is slow, the menu system is horrible, the graphics are subpar, the battles feel like you're doing nothing.  With these kinds of cons taunting the game, it's hard to recommend it even to die hard Dragon Quest fans.

Garnett,"They always say, whenever another company takes over another organization they do things differently, and sometimes it is not for the best. One of them is release of Sims 3 and that EA is the one calling the shots.  I have had fun with the bug-infested game for a while, and as much as I enjoyed the game with its numerous glitches, I think about the time they with-held the game a couple months from being released to retail stores in Feburary.  For whatever reason they did that for, this game seems very un-polished, unfinished, and quickly developed.

I give EA some props, the game is good to play, when it's working, but the bugs, the glitches, and other problems with this game make it unjoyable.  The lack of things left out are numerous, and it seems like it is missing something.  I played Sims 2 for a while and realized I had more fun playing that game than I did with Sims 3.  Lots of my friends who played Sims 3, said the same exact thing, it doesn't seem like The Sims anymore, more like a water downed clone version of Maxis; The Sims 2.

This being said, I strongly urge people to wait a couple months to get the game after the updates.  You will be gravely dissapointed if you decide to buy it and install the game.  EA has a lot to do and I doubt game updates will be released anytime soon. For now enjoy Sims 2 while you can, and you might never leave that game anyways because Sims 3 is a little different. Sims 3 characters have fatter faces, look more like plastic barbie dolls that will almost resemble Ken barbie and Jen the Hologram barbies.... Building a house can be confusing to most, and sometimes your sims or npc's will do some wierd out stuff. What a nice job EA??

A big change for one, you can't create your own neighborhoods from scratch or have your other families live in the same neighborhood for some odd reason.  There is a huge bug with your families becoming automatic npc's while your playing another sims family you created.  Than they vanish before your very eyes the next time you play, maybe the game ate them for lunch?? The game likes to suck up your memory from both your video card and mem sticks and crash to desktop regardless of what high-end video card you have.  NPC's will become stuck or won't leave sometimes when you ask them to.  They will stand there forever or become stuck in some object.  Objects will look distorted in most ATI x4000 series video cards, and Nvidia 280 cards.  When you venture out of the house to a supermarket or some other places, you won't be able to see your Sims.  It is more like rabbit holes, which is a huge let down.  The list goes on but here are one of the main problems.

I give this game some positives, you get to travel outside your house without loading on instant.  You get to select many more features from your traits and your Sim developes more complicated personality.  Sims seem more in depth to how they feel to.  But otherwise noted above, if you were a huge fan of Sims 2, lets hope you will like Sims 3, because I am one of those people who will run back to the game that is more intuitive to enjoyment.  I give this game 5 out of 10 and 2/5.  I just hope EA knows what went wrong, and hopefully they will work out their technical problems within the game.

-Game is freaky but they mostly use a disgting and over the top amount of violence and gore.  I would not reccomend this game to someone under the age of 20 or 21.

It kind of reminds me of when Super Street Fighter II Turbo was the last of the Street Fighter series that required any skill whatsoever. With this game, it seems to have gone in a direction of trying to step away what was expected from a MotorStorm game, and go a bit more cartoon graphics. I can see they really tried to put some effort into the constant changing environments, but they probably should have looked at examples like Sonic Allstars Transformed for better tips on how to make the environment change without it just becoming an annoying thing that flings debris around.

What I have found the lest fun about this game is environmental objects you can collide with and no clear paths as to where you're supposed to be heading. Too often enough the objects laying in your way are not visible and you don't see them till you crash into them, and so many parts of the track look like paths and roads and you end up crashing into them, basically relying on the restart to face you in the right direction again.

Sue me if i'm wrong, but racing games like these are about speed and how fast you can get around the circuit, and whoever designed this idea here with things everywhere and no clear indication of direction really was not thinking straight. Especially with the stiff controls. Compared to other MotorStorm games, this game has the worst controls I've played so far. It's stiff and the car won't drift, it just kind of spins and aims in a direction on the spot before heading that way. Why did they change this? There was nothing wrong with the previous controls and programming. Now I feel like i'm in a run away car with little steering just closing my eyes and holding on tight hoping to finish the race.

I managed to get through rookie mode, and start advanced, but like every other MotorStorm game, it's just the same thing repeating over and over again in a different vehicle so you don't chose the same path you chose the first time. Once again, it's either a you fluke the win, or you have to memories the tracks before you can get a qualifying position. With this game, it's not even so much memorizing the best route, it's just memorizing where to avoid stupid objects on the track you can't see so you don't crash.

My husband and I played this recently and we both think it's the worst of the LEGO titles we've played, and we both enjoyed the first Batman game.  While the standard story mode is still here, it's very short.  They also took out the ability to play story mode as the villains, which I thought made the first Batman game pretty fun.  The remainder 80% of the game is spent wandering around Gotham City, which they made too large.  If I wanted to wander in a vast environment, I'd play Assassin's Creed or similar ""adult"" games.  And probably the biggest problem with wandering around Gotham City is that none of the landmarks seem very exciting or distinct.  It's not like wandering around Middle Earth in the LEGO Lord of the Rings game where Hobbiton is very different from Moria.  Most of Gotham City seem unexcitingly similar to me.  I'll admit a large part of it is maybe because I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan while I'm just kind of ambivalent to the DC universe.  But you know it's  a problem when it seems like it takes a lot longer to get from one end of Gotham to another than from Hobbiton to Mordor.

To compound the problem of the too-vast world, the character movements in this free mode are insane (in a bad way).  Holding down the analog, the character starts off at a normal pace.  Then within two seconds, the character speeds up in this difficult-to-control run made worse by the bad camera angle.  It's very difficult when there are fine movements involved in a jumping puzzle or you're trying to go in a straight line to collect coins.  The flying in the levels themselves aren't terrible.  Press a button to fly straight up and then move in the direction you want.  Flying in the open world of Gotham makes me want to throw my controller out the window because they made it totally different from flying in the levels!  There's now a target that you have to direct your character towards and you can't fly straight up or down.  And any time you jump off a building to fly, the camera angle changes drastically so it takes time to orient yourself.  It's made worse by the fact that the camera angle changes to zoom up on your character's ass when that happens.  Like, how are we supposed to see anything?  I probably wouldn't have been as annoyed if it wasn't so hard to get anywhere in Gotham City thanks to the insane controls.

The co-op split screen is also terrible.  I know an option is to not make it ""dynamic"" so that it doesn't crazily split the screen up.  But that in turn gives us two smaller screens that make it hard to see our environment in order to solve puzzles.  So on a ""dynamic"" split screen, the camera angles go all crazy sometimes when one of our characters is flying and the other is trying to aim the Batarang at a target.  I know the ""dynamic"" split screen has been around for several LEGO games already.  But I think this is the game that is really negatively impacted by the split screen because aiming with a weapon while another character is flying is used so much.  Also, I think the split screen in all the games take the fun out of playing co-op.  I remember in the first Indiana Jones game, it was so much fun because the two characters interacted and we could see what each other was doing during co-op.  With the ""dynamic"" split screen, it feels like we're playing two separate games at the same time.

In previous LEGO games, I've always wanted to and tried to go back and get as close to 100% completion as I can.  This is the only game in which I have very little desire to do so.  The huge Gotham City level is totally unappealing to me.  One can play as villains by finding them and beating them up.  That sounds interesting in theory.  Except all it takes to beat up a villain is three punches.  No, really!  Just walk up to Man-Bat and punch him three times and he's yours to play with.  It doesn't even take Superman's laser vision to kill him.  It's the same with all the villains in the Gotham world.  I thought at least they would be mini-levels, considering how short the actual levels were.  But nope.  Just three punches and you're done.

The only good thing about the game is that it left out the rage-inducing levitation puzzles from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.

I guess in conclusion, I just think LEGO is trying to do too much in this game.  Bring back the days when the LEGO characters spoke incoherently!  Bring back the days of a single screen in co-op (or at least use the split screen sparingly)!  Bring back the days of simple, fun puzzles because I don't want grappling hooks and electricity suits and green imagination bricks, etc.!  Bring back the days where 95% of the environment can be destroyed for no good reason!  I was really excited for the LEGO Marvel game, but I think now, I'm afraid I would dislike it as much as I dislike this game.

***Edited to add: as of 28% completion in this game, I'm officially giving up.  Running around the open world of Gotham City was just nauseating!  I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've had my share of games where the camera zooms and moves fairly fast and never had I felt anything that affected me like this game.

The game is basically a rush for the hero to destroy the other player's towers as fast as they are able to build them.  This makes the game very frustrating and takes away the fun and strategy of tower building that you experience during the first person campaign.  I would be happy if they made it so that the hero is unable to destroy towers, but allows the hero to destroy the attacking army and hero.

As I said, the first person campaign is a lot of fun while the multiplayer has the potential to be just as fun or more fun with the proper patches and fixes.",The multiplayer mode needs a lot of work.,1440633600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"01 8, 2011",A3URVWPFJOHT72,B003KMHBCA,zlionsfan,"Board games are great family games, but for some reason they just aren't as prevalent on console systems as you'd think they'd be. As a result, demand is typically high, and quality tends to suffer. EA's also not known for putting forth quality efforts when they're not challenged, so I really shouldn't have had high expectations for this game, and as it turns out, the game actually is disappointing.

The one thing EA gets right is the game itself. Too many older games, both board and video, are released as NEW and IMPROVED versions, but most of them don't appeal to newer gamers: the market for these games consists of the people who played them when they were younger. Monopoly Streets isn't like that: there isn't some kind of crazy remake where you battle other players for properties or anything. You can follow the original rules to the letter (does anyone actually do that at home? We sure didn't), use a predefined set of custom rules, or tweak one of the sets to your liking. (Unfortunately, you can't save your own custom rules; you'll have to choose them each time.) There are enough variations and rules to satisfy pretty much anyone who's experimented with their own rules.

That's about the best of it, though. Every game is a four-player game: there's no option for more or fewer players. The properties each player holds are indicated on the board as you play, but you can't get details on a property (for example, if you're looking to trade or trying to evaluate one), and it's not always easy to tell who owns which properties within a group. The tokens talk during game play, but it's really annoying, and although you can mute the sound, you can't turn off the automation, so you're forced to wait while a token and its corresponding character do a little dance before it moves. (Thankfully, you can turn off the animation that tracks a token from space to space.)

The rules for the ""speed die"" variants are explained very poorly, or in some cases not at all. There's no in-game help, which is really odd: EA's infamous on the sports side for putting together a two-page instruction manual and expecting you to buy a strategy guide to figure out how to play. So if you missed the part that says you can move anywhere when you roll triples, too bad: the game won't tell you that. Not sure why the Bus will only let you move to one of three spaces? Too bad, you get no explanation. Didn't know that once all properties are purchased, Mr. Monopoly moves you to the nearest property on which you'd have to pay rent? You won't find that anywhere. (Yeah, that makes a big difference strategy-wise: you're better off mortgaging your cheap properties to force people to land on the expensive ones.)

The AI, even on Hard, makes terrible decisions. I understand the part about offering you trades unbalanced in its favor, but some are just incomprehensible. It'll ask you to complete its Red monopoly, and in exchange you can have one of three Oranges; the other two are owned by different players, but too bad for you. Those are easy enough to decline, but that doesn't help when one AI offers the trade to another. I've seen an AI give Park Place to another AI who had Boardwalk, getting only a second property in a color group in return. (That game didn't last much longer.) Of course you can use this to your advantage as well ... I thought Hard AI would be more intelligent, and that's disappointing.

You earn points for each game you play, and you can use them to unlock tokens and boards, but really, it doesn't add that much to the game, especially given that you can only have four players. (There's more of a need for additional tokens if you've got more people playing.)

If you have to have a Monopoly game for your console, I guess this one's all right, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. You're better off getting a used copy or renting it from somewhere.",Another weak effort from EA,1294444800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I would dream of boldly going where no man had gone before. I would dream of exploring sme strange space anomaly, meeting a new and deadly race of people with deep dark secrets. I wanted to organize peace or promote war on some small planet caught in civil war.

Star Trek Online at first glance seems to fullfill these childhood dreams. All the magazine previews, the screenshots and the video releasess made this game seem like it was just what every Tekkie dreamed of. Unfortunaly, after playing the game it does not live up to the hype, not even close.

After playing this game through beta and now retail I feel betrayed and lied to. I feel like the victim of an unscruptiolus marketing scheme. This game is all about combat, most of which takes place in space. The space combat is about as comlicated as fire phaser till sheilds go down and finish with a torpedo. Sure you can redirect your sheilds too but it's not too difficult to manage. If you hoped of being able to do creative things like target a specific part of a ship, board a ship to sabatague it, or even negotiate hostilities with an enemy captain you will be let down. Just mash 1 unroll sheilds go down and mash 2, space  combat over.

Ground combat is equally as uncreative and boring. The maps are small and never have anything but enemies and objectives on it. All you do is kill enemies and maybe interact with a console or two. After your done with ground combat you get to beam back up and attack even more ships mashing 1 and 2 and redirecting your sheilds.

The gameplay is frankly boring and redundant. This game is hardly Star Trek. In fact I would go as far as to say the nly thmg star trek about this game is the appearance (phasers, races, ship design, text). The gameplay does not mimic stra trek. You cold just as easy redue the races, ships and a few other tungsten and call this Star Wars online.

It doesn't seem like a sequel to DAO, infact it seems like a DLC for Mass Effect.  There is no depth in the story that will let you continue on through the gameplay.  It is a rather boring storyline and once you finish the game you feel like you accomplished nothing from playing a dumped down game.

Pros:
1) Nice graphical interface for consoles than pc's.
2) Dumbed down JRPG environment to make FFXIII fans squeel.
3) Lots of quest to do in Kirkwall of going from point A to point B.
4) Bioware included HD texture download to make things look better in GTX 460 cards and above.
5) The npc's look have barely anything to say for those who hate reading tons of texts.
6) We get Varric that does most of the talking throughout the game.  Without him the game seems lifeless.
7) We get to see some former characters from DAO.

The Bad:

1) We don't get to talk to our companions anywhere but only certain sections of the game, like for instance the house.  And even there, they don't talk much.  We don't even get to know much about our companions.
2) No changing companions gear? That makes no sense, no upgrading gear at all.
3) Characters don't look too attractive.
4) Every mission is copied and pasted from Kirkwall dungeons to the small mountain forest area you adventure in.
5) Poor story-line, I liked DAO's better.
6) Dumbed down interface resembles Mass Effect 2.
7) No atmosphere, seems bland and boring.

This game is not really a RPG, its more of an JRPG.  If your a true rpger like I am, you will be disappointed.  EA/Bioware decided to drop the ball and use most of the cinematics from ME2 into Dragon AGE 2 ie (Dragon Effect).  The chat wheel is silly, especially when you don't get many options of what to say to your companions.

Your only place to adventure in (so-to-speak) is in Kirkwall and one area outside, and it gets boring walking around the same place over and over. The city feels very lifeless even when NPC's are walking around, theres no life.

The relationships in the game are aweful.  The characters aren't good-looking enough to even bother. Who blurts out I love in a group of people and says kisses to you.  They might as well take relationships out of the game because it doesn't serve a purpose in the game.

Enemy NPC's explosive bodies when dying is very comical and funny, but in reality it makes the game look silly and geared towards FPS players.

The game feels limited, you don't need to pause and set tactics, just point and click and kill, the same thing over and over.

For those who like racing games, or even those who want to try them, this is a good one if you can get it cheap 5-10 dollars.  Those who play a lot of racing games might like this for a change of ""pace"", as there are none of the courses that are in so many racing games. The idea of racing across the US seems like a cool concept, and graphics wise it is fun to play for a little while.  The main problem that I find is the controls and the AI.  Because the cars don't seem/ feel like they're going fast there is a tendency to try to drive full bore, but the cars are so hard to control (the proverbial garbage truck on ice- the most extreme out of about ten- twenty racing games I've played) that the oversteer causes so many crashes and the ensuing clip scene.  Once you learn to slow it down it's a little easier to control but then it becomes apparent there is no real ""racing"" to it.  Example is you need to pass ten cars in a set area; all your doing is pacing out the passing so that the AI doesn't rubberband back so that you typically pass the last car close to the finish to complete that stage.  Since you're not so much trying to control throttle as maintain a even pace, then it's just a matter of weaving back and forth against all the obstacles, but since the control is so loose half the time it's just sheer luck you don't crash or even if you do your car resets and your back to maintaining the throttle and weaving back and forth like you've just finished a twelve pack of O'douls.

2.0,False,"03 12, 2009",A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,B000VJRU44,Delamaine,"Yeah, the Wii Fit is fun and motivational.  However, there are certain things about it that make me wonder if it's really helpful in the long run.  We've had it for 217 days now and here are the quirks I notice:

1.  It asks you the weight of your clothing (estimated).  We all assumed that it took the amount you weighed and subtracted the estimated clothing weight to provide you with your weight for the day.  However, I recently started occasionally weighing myself undressed.  Every time I do that (even though I do tell it my clothes weigh 0 lb) it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds less than the day before, when I wore clothing.  If the next day I weigh myself clothed and tell it my clothes are 2 lb, it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds higher than the day before, when I was undressed.  I really do not believe my weight is fluctuating by 1.5-2.5 pounds a day, so I don't entirely trust the Wii Fit weight calculations.

2.  During the body test, some days I'm good, and some days I'm not.  Just like most people, I suspect.  But some days I will be consistently off-balance across the testing, AND fakely higher in weight (see #1 above), and yet my Wii Fit age is 7-10 years lower than my real age.  By contrast some days I ace all the balance tests and have appeared to ""lose weight"" and my Wii Fit age goes up alarmingly.  I'm 45.  One day my Wii Fit age was 93!  The very next day it was down to 35.  So I don't trust the Wii Fit age calculations.

3.  This may be because our Wii Fit platform is calibrated wrongly, or because everyone in my family is unbalanced (ha ha), but we ALL seem to have our center of balance quite a bit further back than the cross hairs on the tests.  All three of us find ourselves leaning artificially forward in order to hit the cross hairs, instead of standing as we normally do.  When we stand normally, we're back near the bottom edge of the graph.  But the Wii Fit doesn't tell us this is a problem.  So, why have the cross hairs if it doesn't count?

4.  During running exercises, if you don't have a pocket, you're supposed to hold the Wii remote while you run in place.  We have tried it both ways.  Holding the remote makes it jiggle more, and it results in a faster time for the person holding it.  Anyone who puts the remote in a pocket comes in far, far behind on the running games.  So we're not sure which is more accurate.  The remote-in-pocket might not get as much movement as a person running really would have; on the other hand, the remote-in-hand probably gets shaken more than a person running really would.

So, we use it as a fun and general measurement of how we're doing but it's not part of a serious workout or monitoring regimen for us.",Dubious calculations,1236816000,7,,

He is a construction worker from New York during an alternate-early-50's era where the Nazis have conquered Europe and WW2 is still raging on. One day you're on some steel gerders and BOOM! The Nazis begin attacking the United States!! You regroup with...the National Guard? And its up to you and your Resistance group to stop the Nazi invasion.

You'll travel the east coast of the United States to repel the attack. You'll start off in a decent replica of New York (and at one point will see the Chrysler Building ripped in half and laying in the street), Washington D.C. to save some fictional resistance general from execution and the constitution from being burned (which is an achievement), in the New York subway system, and a few other areas. The environments look, for the most part, pretty good.

The action is pretty intense and you can do these grapple moves where you run up and either use the Nazi as a human shield for a little bit or you beat the bajesus out of them in different ways. However, Turning Point is a very buggy and glitchy game, so the icon to indicate you can grapple the people sometimes does not show up until you are on the verge of death. You can run up and press the B button numerous times until you actually do grab the person. You get a bunch of ""modified"" WW2 weapons such as the ""new"" MP50, Gewher 45 (theres a new ""Vampir"" version that has thermal vision for oyu to snipe with), the M1 Garand, the version of the Thompson with the drum on the bottom of the barrel, the ""combat shotgun"", a multi-barreled Panzershrek, and the potato masher hand grenades.

Again, this game is really glitchy. For instance theres this stage you go into near the end of the game...its a bridge. You walk out and theres enemies on EVERY side of you..they can actually hit you through the wholes in the bridge but you can't shoot them. Sometimes you'll go to aim down your iron sights, only to find you can't shoot or get out of the aim mode for a couple of seconds to a minute. Sometimes your grenades won't explode or sometimes an enemy can hit you from a mile away with the shotgun..a lot of time the game will freeze up, the frame rates will drop, and finally the sound will cut out sometimes.

The AI is pretty bad too. Sometimes you can run right into view and sit there for about 3-5 minutes before they take cover and start shooting. Its pretty embarrassing for CodeMasters to have released such a terrible AI system upon the world.

The music is pretty good though. Its mainly an orchestrated score to help you feel heart wretched or pumped up. Additionally, some power sets like the Chrysler building being destroyed will push any New Yorker (like me) over the edge and want to finish the game.

The ending was somewhat believable. You board this Nazi Zeppelin that has a nuke on it, and you must disarm it before it blows up (I think) New York. Anyway, you kill everyone on the aircraft and reach the nuke. You take one look and notice you have 10 seconds left, and you attempt to stop it. The whole time your commander is telling you good job and what not but your character does not know how to stop a nuclear device. So, he sits down, shakes his head, and the nuke blows up in the sky. Your a casualty of war, but you stopped the missle from actually being launched at a target.

Overall, Turning Point: Fall of Liberty could have been so much better if CodeMasters would have taken more time to work the bugs out and make the gun power more balanced.

2.0,False,"11 30, 2014",A1LHDO3D99UJSJ,B001CMIUYS,Vic 2.0,"After getting some criticism for the linearity and annoying characters in FF10, you'd think Square would never make the same mistakes again. And especially after FF12, I had some hope for the series. Not anymore. Not only did they come back to linearity and annoying characters; they made these things infinitely WORSE than in 10. Five of the six characters you get are either mildly or extremely annoying, and of course the one that ISN'T is the one you get in your party last (and it takes FOREVER to get your entire party together in one place, BTW). This could be overlooked, however, if only the gameplay made up for it.

But it doesn't come close. The game is ridiculously linear, with the only chance to do any sort of exploring being near the very end of the game. And even then, there are only, like, three directions you can split off into (with one of them being the way you have to go to progress the story anyway). Get the picture? It's like you're playing Gears of War, with the added expectation that you somehow build your characters up.

Which brings me to the Crystarium system. Wow, what a letdown. Unlike in FF12, you get practically no freedom to develop each character as you see fit. Each character has their own list of abilities and stats that can be gained, which means if you want one character to be a Medic (White Mage, for you FF veterans), you can do this in theory with any character but some will never be near as good as others no matter how bad you want it. And of course, some roles aren't accessible to some players until near the end of the game anyway! But it is always clear they want you to do it their way, not yours. There's one character that gets a ridiculous amount of HP while most others fall dramatically behind. You can find discussions on the internet about how this character is better than that one because he/she can learn an ability the other can't. It's ridiculous. Why bother giving us the ""choice"" at all, when it's obvious you think there is only a couple of ""right"" ways to do it?

And the linearity doesn't stop with the (lack of) exploration or (lack of) choices when it comes to how you develop your party either. Even in battle, there is usually a ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to win the fight. How do you know this? Well, once you're done fighting and you get to feeling really good about how well you kicked the enemy's ass, a screen pops up with a rating of your performance. You see it plain as day, 1 out of 5 stars. The game is essentially telling you you failed at doing it correctly. And this really means you didn't win the fight FAST enough. It's all about speed in this game. And it's more than just a rating; it determines your chances of getting any items after battle. And even that would be acceptable if it was consistent. Yet some enemies are noticeably more difficult to get five stars on no matter what strategy you use. Plus, it's not like you can go back and try most of these battles again because, as I mentioned, the game in general is unbearably linear! 70% (or more) of the locations cannot be revisited, not even near the end of the game.

The battles also operate by only allowing you to assign ROLES to two of the characters while in battle; you're never allowed to directly control their actions. You can switch their roles in the middle of battle, but you can't ever customize what they do like you could in all the others. And you can't switch to start controlling one of these other two in battle, either. This effectively means that if the character you're controlling dies, the battle's over. There's no such thing as reviving the leader.

Another thing that sucks about the Crystarium, that I almost forgot, is how it only lets your characters advance to a certain point and then you have to proceed with the storyline before more of it is ""unlocked"". And it takes FOREVER for every character to be able to even BEGIN learning another set of skills (""job class"" for the veterans once more). So even if you try to level-grind in this one by running back and forth along the narrow corridor it gives you throughout most of the game, hoping enemies you beat will respawn, there's little point.

Let's see here. Money! Takes way too long to get the gil you need to do anything of importance. And you need it in this game to upgrade your weapons and accessories, which you will need to read a guide online or buy the book to do efficiently because you get no hints at what each choice in upgrading your weapon is going to really do to it. You have to use components to upgrade with, and have no idea how many of each component you'll need to get the job done until you've already used them up.

This game is not all bad. I like how if you die in battle, the game doesn't make you start from the last save point but just outside the battle so it's less frustrating that way. I also like that you don't have to keep track of MP and the game restores your HP and all that after every battle as well. It has a pretty good story (though it suffers from awful voice acting and narrative), a good presentation both in and out of menus, and of course amazing graphics. It really does look gorgeous. But it is mostly a game for show, not very fun to play at all. Not IMO, anyway. And it certainly does not contain half of the things that made the series great all these years.

A gem is placed somewhere on the board and it is a race to the jewel...as soon as you reach the jewel you have to face an enemie that defends the gem and if defeated you win the gem.

I'll start off with what I like about the controller.  It feels really good in the hands.  Ergonomics are great, and for the most part the buttons all feel good as well.  The D-pad and analog sticks seem better than average.  The L2 and R2 triggers have a loose wobble to them when you're not pressing down on them, but this wasn't a big deal.  I like the backlighting when it works.  It's attractive and looks quality.  The only complaint I have is that the Turbo and Clear buttons are very easy to confuse with the Start and Select buttons when you're not looking; over time I got used to it however.

The real problems I had with these controllers happened when I tried to connect them.  I will warn you right now: these are not properly made to connect two USB dongles/controllers at once.  I couldn't get both to connect for the life of me, and the few times I did it was short lived.  Sometimes one would connect but press all the buttons twice, which I can only assume meant that it was connecting to both dongles simultaneously.  I tried putting the dongles in different ports, angling them away from each other, everything, to no avail.  Then, to top it all off, when even one of them was plugged in I would get terrible wifi transfer speeds  Next I tried to connect one via bluetooth to my Raspberry Pi.  I got it to pair, but it would only work in the shell menus and not in the controller configuration dialog.  Finally I decided to try one wired.  While it worked, the controller charges while tethered so the lights continually blink on and off until it's charged; I found this quite irritating.

To conclude, this controller has promise, but until the connection issues are resolved I can only recommend buying one at most.  Any more will give you headaches.","Great ergonomics, terrible connectivity",1505865600,,{'Color:': ' With Bracket'},

The game punishes you for being good. 1st place? Not for long!

Everyone from 4th-12th place gets stars, red shells, green shells, blue shells (which hit exclusively those in 1st place), lightening / POW which hit all but he or she whom uses it, and speed boost. Once hit by a blueshell, youll then get bombarded by green shells and red shells and run off the track by other players. Once hit by lightening or POW you lose all your itmes. Period.

But do not fret 1st placer, you will get so many banana's that you actually go banana's. Thats not all, you may get an upside down cube... or *gasp* green shell that you can blindly throw backwards.

But if you suck at this game, boy are you gonna love it. You get stars to knock everyone out of the way, or even a bullet which is basically an automatic first place. Screw up again and again? No worry, more stars and bullets.

I don't mind chance, I love chance (such as poker). But imagine texas hold em if the losing person automatically got pocket aces every hand while the chip leader got 7 2 offsuit. Not so interested in betting anymore, eh?

It wouldn't be so bad if you got to save an item after getting hit, eg you get a mushroom while in 6th place and get hit by lightening but you don't drop the mushroom. Or if, FOR THE LOVE OF (insert preferred deity) the first place person could get some kinda shield... every once in awhile.

Nintendo's pretty damned arrogant thinking I want to play Luigi's Circuit 32,768 times in order to unlock Baby Daisy.

The first thing you'll notice is that the game is actually quite pretty for a Nintendo DS game, and what it pulls off on the screen is very impressive from a technical standpoint.

Pointing at places on the screen makes your ninja go there.  Touching down on the screen makes Ryu move there, tapping enemies hits them with ranged attacks, swiping them makes you attack them with your sword, and just brushing up makes you jump.  The game eases you into its difficulty curve so that at first it works fairly well.  The game is a giant linear path (excluding your ""hub"" world between missions) of a series of ""kill every enemy in the room to proceed"" gameplay.  It works well for the first hour or two, but for the next 3-4 you'll be rolling your eyes and trudging on only because the attack interaction is novel and works pretty well.  Some of these rooms seriously take upwards of 10 minutes of non-stop respawning enemies; may I repeat, the level design is horrible.

By the time you get to the last third of the game, however, many of the encounters are either in such poorly designed terrain or have too many enemies on the screen to make the controls manageable.  When the screen is completely filled with enemies, the game simply can't tell the difference between: move here, slash this enemy or ranged attack this enemy.  Jump is similarly confounded in being unable to tell if you're trying to slash a target or jump.  A single incorrect input can be the difference between a flawless battle and losing half your health, so you have to at least keep moving (also a problem since your attacks typically commit you to being unable to dodge/change course for several seconds). With any option for careful control thrown right out the window, the only viable way to attack is to simply swipe the screen back and forth to fly around and slash around wildly.  Bad level design then pairs up with lackluster control to provide a very poor game experience.  There are also times when the terrain is a hindrance, particularly on narrow ledges where you have about a pixel-thin ribbon to touch that means the difference between your character moving and just standing still doing nothing (or getting munched on by the damn ghost fishes).

Some of the last bosses are also an exercise in tedium.  They are the kind that take an hour and a half because to beat them takes 30+ minutes straight (29.5 of which they are completely invincible) plus a half-dozen retries learning their patterns through trial and error.

To summarize, this game is very pretty to look at by DS standards.  It starts out interesting, but poor level design and an eventual breakdown in the game's  combat interface very handily kill what fun the game elicits in the early stages.","Horrible control, horrible game design, pretty graphics",1278892800,2,,

BioWare simply over-promised and under-delivered, as many game developers are apt to do to generate hype and sales. BioWare's biggest deception was the promise that player choice would impact the plot.

Now that we've seen Mass Effects 2 and 3, we know that the claim was a bald-faced lie. Initial interviews with BioWare developers suggested that there would be literally ""hundreds of permutations"" of branching plotlines that would have had a significant impact on the main storyline. Simply put, the idea was that by playing a different Renegade or Paragon Shepard, or some flip-flopping permutation thereof, you could affect the fate of the universe. Skeptics, myself included, knew that this couldn't possibly be true, especially with BioWare's promise of full voice acting and cinematic presentation. The research, development, technical and writing challenges alone would be unimaginable.

So we were left with the illusion of choice: ""choices"" that feel emotionally powerful for a moment, but have zero effect on the outcome of the game. I won't bother giving major plot spoilers on a game this old, but suffice it to say, it really doesn't matter whether you like Kaidan or Ashley better. It also doesn't matter if you think Anderson or Udina would be a better leader. None of the choices you make will have a lasting effect on the universe of Mass Effect or its sequels. So what does that leave you?

All of these broken promises would have been acceptable if the gameplay were up to snuff. Instead, Mass Effect is an awkward third-person shooter with ham-handed ""RPG style"" character development shoehorned in. The cover system is terribly inconsistent and easily eclipsed by Gears of War, a game that predated Mass Effect by nearly a year. (This is fixed in Mass Effects 2 and 3). Weapons are shackled to a poorly conceived ""heat-buildup"" system that was mercifully scrapped in the sequels. The inventory management of your completely frangible items is infamously god-awful, especially on the PC version, which requires multiple clicks to delete each and every useless item (which you will have to do frequently, sometimes multiple times per mission).

The best thing about Mass Effect is that it gives background to the excellent Mass Effect 2. With MUCH improved gameplay, more interesting characters/hireable teammates, and a refreshingly dark plot, Mass Effect 2 dispatches with much of BioWare's false RPG pretense and delivers a satisfying third-person shooter. Mass Effect 3, for all of its infamous plot ""twists,"" manages to refine Mass Effect 2's gameplay further for another great gameplay experience. The multiplayer is an addictive and polished spin on Gears of War 2's ""Horde Mode"" and is a nice touch overall.

Let's face it: BioWare hasn't crafted a good roleplaying game since Baldur's Gate 2. Even then, I suspect much of its quality was the result of executive oversight from the legendary team at Black Isle. Mass Effect is a poor compromise between the cinematic aspirations of the Xbox 360 generation and true CRPG elements defined back in the 1990's. The purpose of this review isn't to make you hate the Mass Effect series: it's to save you time and money by pushing you straight to Mass Effect 2 and 3. And if you must torment yourself through 20+ hours of awkward gameplay, go with the Xbox 360 version.

If you've played games on any platform you've probably come across this style of gameplay. It is found everywhere. There are rows of colored bubbles on the top of the screen. You have a bubble launcher on the bottom part of the screen. Your aim is to get three or more bubbles of the same color to touch. If you do, all of those bubbles will ""fall down"". Over time you clear the screen of all bubbles if you're good enough.

I think part of my issue is that I've played this game SO many times on so many different platforms - and in many cases it is done far better than it is presented here.

The sound is annoying. It is a high-pace, electronic kind of song which gets annoying very quickly. Even kids must wear down after hearing this too many times. I'm not sure anybody could find this enjoyable.

I'm a fan of the Wiimote and use it on many games. Here it gets frustrating. You're trying to arrange a bank shot off a wall and it just doesn't go properly. This game is all about making those angles work. When the controller gets in the way, it's not fun.

The backgrounds and menus are sub-par. So many other Wii games do amazing jobs with the menus and graphics. Here they are simple and cheezy. They don't even have to be special! They just have to be professional looking, and they are not.

Add in flying saucers which zoom across your screen to distract you, and not a lot of variety in the game play, and I'm just not connecting with this one. Again it's not that I mind the premise!

First off, as a warning to people who don't know what this basically is, this falls more in the genre of interactive visual novel than traditional video game. The majority of the time, you'll be simply reading a story that you have no control over.

So, that's fine, as long as the story's good, right? Unfortunately, this game is another one of those mystery concepts that never really delivers. The setting and overall idea of the game is great, but the revelations never pay off. It's easy to propose a mystery, and it's a good way to hook people into the experience to dangle the plot twist. The thing is, you have to have a good revelation to have the experience really pay off. I won't spoil anything here, but I'll say it's astonishingly awful.

The actual gameplay segments of the game are pretty terrible as well, and not just because you'll be fighting the controls. The puzzle solutions are often complete nonsense. You'll find yourself doing petty math a lot of the time. Seriously. The puzzles in this game are frequently along the lines of ""if train A leaves the station at two pm and there's fifteen people on board, and train B leaves its station..."" etc. If that's your idea of fun, then maybe these will appeal to you.

Ms. Pac Man: 2.5/5

I love Ms. Pac Man, but it's impossible to play on this. You play tiny, or huge, kinda like that one world in SM64. When you play tiny, it's too dificult to see where the ghosts are and such. The huge screen is useful, untill your scrolling down and run into a ghost you couldn't see.

Galaga: 3/5

It's fine, but it's boring. No value is brought to you when your playing.

Galaxian: 3/5

It's the same with Galaga, no replay value at all. I don't know why that's happening, but something dosn't feel right playing Galaga or Galaxian on the GBA.

Dig Dug: 4/5

This is very fun on this, one of the only games I play (I'm gonna sell this game soon). But the controls can be funky.

Pole Postion: 0/5

But as for me. I want some sort of realism. It doesn't have to be perfect, but man, let's get it close.

I truly believe that NO ONE at EA has ever watched a NASCAR race. If you have watched a race, let me put it in perspective for you. I have gotten AIRBORNE, FLIPPED 5 or 6 times, and seen other AI cars do the same. WE ALL FINISH THE RACE & FIX THE DAMAGE WITH A PIT STOP !!! Anyone who watches NASCAR knows that cars that flip 5 or 6 times DO NOT FINISH 99% of the time. The only way to DNF in this game is to run out of gas or get so much damage that you blow your engine. AI cars never DNF. They can flip, explode, bounce, jump, get explosive diarrhea or whatever and they will always be there at the end.

In real NASCAR races, cars blow engines, the ""big one"" happens now and then, cars wreck out, etc. Not in NASCAR 06 !!! You want stats ?? NASCAR 06 has got em'.....NOT !! You can't keep track of anything except the standings for the current season. No trophy room, no personal stats or anything.

They also took a good ""two stick"" control system and added a crappy, poorly responsive one. Bring back the old controls !!

The rivalry system sucks too. You just tap someone, even if you had NOTHING to do with it and suddenly, the guy who hit you hates you and will die trying to ""get you back"". Even if you are in a chain reaction wreck that starts waaaaay ahead of you, everyone behind you who makes contact with you as you try to avoid the mess or spin out, will hate you.

Also, if you are in ""Fight to The Top Mode"" and buy a racing team, there are issues. There is a major glitch that freezes the game if you try to drive for Dale Jr or Roush in the Busch series and it will make you start completely over. Also, let's say you buy Penske Racing after accumulating enough money over the years. You cannot change the name from Penske to let's say ""Joes Racing"" or anything else you might want. And despite being the owner of the 2 car, 12 car, and your car, you can only modify yours and cannot modify any of the other cars on YOUR team, nor can you modify, hire or fire drivers for YOUR team.

I could go on and on. I am not just an EA basher. I have loved the Madden series and so wish that we could get a good, realistic NASCAR game. I would be a loyal purchaser if they could get it right, but I will NEVER buy another EA nascar game until I rent one and see what I am looking for.

-Had to set the game on easy just to make it out of the starting gate
-This is not an open world game
-You can not freely explore your areas of travel, instead you have to back track, so there is no roaming where you want to go.
no climbing or hopping over obstacles like you could do in the newest Tomb Raider game..
-As far as I can tell there is also no rolling in the game. (Maybe I haven't figured it out yet) So in battle..
-Heavy emphasis on switching combat styles in mid battle (at least this seems to be the case)
-Clunky Combat/combat system

Now for the more positive things
+Atmospheric game ) doesn't rank "" 2014 tomb raider quality"" but.. its here
+Crafting system is pretty cool. More nitty gritty than I expected.
+You can craft on the fly! Which considering the lack of freedom you have everywhere else.. this really
kinda surprises me.
+Traps work well, does a lot of damage
+Magic works well (When you use fireballs the enemies feel the heat)
+Projectile weapon seems to work really well (Crossbow)

The main thing for me, when I deal with any game, is exploration and how well my character interacts with the environment and THE FREEDOM of acts my character has.. with the environment and enemies..etc.  This game is really lacking on some key fronts for a adventure rpg that has come out in 2014. Seriously I hate pressing a button to engage in an action (press 'A' to climb on this ledge). That's 1980's... garbage.

It is very different from similar games (Halo, Splinter Cell, etc).  Although I like those other games, I did not like Metal Gear Solid.
In short, it has VERY long movie scenes (I think I had to watch about 20 minutes of video before playing, and the game is constantly pausing to show you other short movies).

I felt bad for the little guy, but I also understood that short lives are the way of hamsters.  Short lives should not be the way of enormously expensive pieces of electronic equipment.

I held off on getting an Xbox 360 for a long time after launch because of the high number of hardware failures reported for the system, especially after one of my friends had to return his Xbox for service -SIX TIMES- within a year.  After Microsoft announced that the new ""Falcon"" chip set would virtually ensure a long service life for new 360s, my girlfriend spent almost $400 to get me one as a birthday gift.  It died yesterday, after 10 months of intermittent use, giving me the delightful three light ""Red Ring of Death"" as it expired.  Granted, Microsoft has extended the warranty for the Xbox 360 to 3 years for ""RROD"" issues, and thus even as I type this a free shipping box is en route to me so my dead machine can take a trip to Texas, but widespread catastrophic hardware failures are ridiculous no matter how you slice it.  The best part is that my own Xbox won't be returned to me - instead I'll get someone else's dead Xbox that has also been returned and subsequently repaired.  It's even possible that instead of getting back a machine with the relatively robust Falcon hardware, I could get back a machine using one of the two previous (and much less stable) hardware configurations. To say that I'm concerned in an understatement.

WHEN IT WORKS the Xbox 360 is an excellent gaming system that features stunning graphics, a large game library, and a solid online experience (Though in all honesty I'd rather play with my friends in my own living room than with random strangers.)  As of 2 days ago I'd have easily rated the console a solid 4 stars (Not five - the need to sink another $100 on a wireless device to connect to the internet and the annoying high cost for peripherals and software counts against it.), but as of tonight I feel as if I'm being generous to rate it with 2.  You should never have to qualify a statement about an extremely expensive piece of equipment with ""when it works"".

Even worse is that Microsoft hasn't been forthcoming with consumers about the cause of all these ""general hardware failures"".  They're apparently caused by the system overheating, but I'm not in any sense a hardcore gamer and I don't go on marathon gaming binges.  My machine got maybe 3-5 hours of play per week and sat in a well-ventilated area (A ""framework"" style shelf that has neither sides nor a back in order to provide the console with maximum airflow.).  Despite recommendations by some other users, I'm unwilling to buy an external fan for two reasons: 1.) I don't feel as if a consumer should have to spend extra money on a peripheral to ensure that a product will actually function as advertised and 2.) These external cooling fans have also been reported to damage the console and Microsoft has announced that evidence of their use will resulting in a voiding of one's warranty.

Honestly, if you're willing to take a gamble on your console randomly biting the dust then the Xbox 360 provides a fun gaming experience.  When it works, the 360 is awesome, but for $300+ ""when it works"" just doesn't cut it for me.

2.0,False,"11 9, 2007",A1DENY4Q39HD0N,B000R2XJJK,M. Benigni,"I start this review with a confession:  I haven't finished the game yet.  In fact, I've only played through most of the quests outside Vizima; I'm not yet into the city proper.  Alledgedly the game ""picks up"", but I'm seriously running out of patience after investing many hours, bored out of my skull.  Here are a list of observations:

The graphics engine is really lovely (excepting a lot of random aliasing at night, which I try to tell myself are fireflies) and so are the sounds.  The voice acting is above average, but the conversations are often structured poorly and are therefore not believable.  People offer the same dialog choices over and over even though previous conversations should have made them obsolete, resulting in conversations that make no sense.  (Especially annoying, the conversation trees frequently dump you out when you intend to continue speaking, so you have to click on a character again, to hear his/her oddly identical opening phrases once more.)

This game ships with a hefty manual, but it is amazing how little information is actually provided.  Like most recent game manuals, it's just installation instructions, a pile of spoilers for those interested, and not much else.  This comes to your attention as you level up and find yourself navigating the most senseless skill tree of all time.  Pre-requisites are unclear, skill distinctions are unclear, so what the heck, why not just select them all at random?  That will be really fun.

So character customization is out the window.  8 hours into the game, inventory has proven mostly useless, so trading is equally uninteresting.  Gameplay is reduced to repetetive combat, and walking from place to place waiting for the odd conversations to spawn new quests and/ or cutscenes.  Oh, had I forgotten to mention the walking?  The outdoor environments are relatively large, and walking from point A to B happens essentially in realtime which, again, is insanely boring.  Never have I seen a game so desperately in need of a fast travel solution.  (Top it all off with long fences, your inability to jump over a fence, or even step off a ledge without a staircase, and the whole world becomes a big, dull maze.)

When you do finally get to where your going, the boredom theme reaches it's apex:  eternal load screens.  Everytime you enter or leave an indoor location, you'll see as many as four delays.  The current screen will pause for a few seconds, followed by a saving screen, followed by a generic loading screen, followed by (I couldn't make this up) a location-specific loading screen.  And *each* of these are longer than any loading screen I've seen in any video game ever.  If you suffer through this only to find your destination less interesting than you hoped (quite likely) you'll have to turn around and wait for it all over again, just to go back outside.  Enjoy.

Other niggles:  if you expect the map to aid in your travels, note that there are no notations on it.  You'll need to mouse over every location waiting for text to pop-up over its mysteriously identical dot markers.  After you've waited a couple of seconds for it to - you guessed it - load.

I could go on and on with the little niggles, but in many ways the game is very polished.  The real issues are pacing, and the nearly meaningless skill tree.  As for pacing, how many hours are we expected to invest before a game begins to entertain, or even make a point?  I started to think about this during one of the ""minigames"", essentially rolling dice with the locals.  I guess this is somewhat appropriate for a simulation of a boring rainy night in a medievel 'burb, but you know, I've got a Playstation in the next room, and could probably find something more fun to do.  Failing that, maybe I could get some chores done.

- it does not have an amazing story (so far, since i still haven't finish the game)
- poor character development, players don't get any attachment to the character
- long and repetitive gameplay
- 85% naval battle, not what i am looking for in an AC game

After EA bought the exclusive rights to the NFL games, I was rather peeved.  Madden 2007 for the PS3 just enforces the reasons for my dismay.

Pros:

- NFL foolball

- Improved graphics from the previous generation of video game consoles (not by the leaps and bounds you'd expect though)

-  That's about it

Cons:

- Graphics not up to the quality you'd expect from next gen technology.

- Controls feel 'off', especially on defense.

- change of the speed burst button from X to R2...this was very difficult to get used to.

- create-a-player was ruined.  Yeah, it was kind of cheap to be able to build the perfect player.  Now you have to participate in drills to set your created player's attributes.  While fine in theory, the drills (think scounting combine...bench press, 40yd dash, etc) weren't well executed.  I really noticed the 'off' feel of the controls while running through a tackling drill with a LB.  It was the same setup as the Mini-Camp drill from previous games (which I normally ruled at), but I could barely make a tackle.  The players just didn't feel responsive.

Bottom line, this game felt rushed.  I had a feeling EA would let the quality of their NFL game slip now that there's no competition.  I can't even recommend renting this game, let alone buying it.

By no means am I the best player in Battlefield but I can tell you my KDR has not gotten any worse but it has actually improved because of the shape of the mouse.  I came from the RAT 5, which I love and have used for 3 years, but the claw grip was a bit uncomfortable for long periods of gaming. (>6 hours).  I decided to try this mouse because of the more contoured grip that allowed my palm to sit on the mouse and not hover over.  Its different but comfortable.  I will have an opportunity to do a 13+ gaming marathon in the next few weeks so I will be more able to know if the comfort level has really changed.  The wireless feature is great and I don't see any latency when I play and the additional buttons allow me to map a few more things I like to have on button presses and not on the scroll wheel.  It grips very nice and move very well with little resistance.  It is a bit heavy but I like my mice heavy so not a big change.  It no longer comes with an Eneloop battery like I saw in the YouTube video but a generic Eni-time brand.  Not a deal breaker because I can replace it with an eneloop. Overall I really like the mouse but wired the cord is really too stiff to play with so it will be used to charge only.

Update:I give this product 2 stars because the battery only has about a 3 hour charge.  If you got the Eni-Time battery with your purchase instead of the Eneloop I would recommend throwing it away and buying Eneloop brand.  This was a big disapointment since some get Eneloop and some will get Eni-Time batteries.  Customer service took two months to get back with me on why this happens and their answer was ""Sorry we cant help you""  This mouse became a wired mouse until I got my new batteries defeating the purpose of having a wireless mouse.

I was so excited for this game.  I got it as part of a ps4 bundle. I can't tell you how often I longingly looked at it in a store, only to say 'I will get it soon, there will be  a promotion, be patient as you save up for your ps4' [it also led me to conclude that this is the game that will never go on sale.  ever.] [which i finally just went all in on just to get bloodborne lol]
  I am so underwhelmed and disappointed. I thought after the opening movie, 'this will be great!'

oh, how wrong I was.

 Everyone said I should play it, that it would be awesome.  Maybe that impacted my expectations.  I felt like I was playing the walking dead meets uncharted.
So here are my complaints:
1. Not realistic.  Everyone said it would be.  Sure, you can die easily--that's realistic.  But enemies never run out of bullets.  Never.
And you can't hold much [but you can hold an inexhaustible supply of collectibles.]
2. Joel has a magic super mutant hearing ability that lets him see around corners.  and through space and time.
3. The relationship between joel and the little girl is predictable and boring.  Maybe it's because i play so much silent hill.  I wanted something different.  and if you've watched the walking dead i swear some of this stuff was copied. why not be UNpredictable and have him be a guy trying to like survive.  or a weak guy.  or something a little bit more imperfect and human with more growth.  maybe he could actually be a screw up, making bad choices left and right.  or something more interesting.  not rambo.
4. battle system is straight forward and incredibly boring.  just shoot, run, or sneak up on someone.  oh, and joel has super strength he can bash anyone's head against a wall
5. I really did not [again] want to see a bad game like uncharted reborn in a new form
Why I didn't give it one star:
1. It was nice to see a female character that wasn't overly sexualized. no loli [bc of her age] no weirdness.  it was nice.
2. Nice graphics--but at this point [and let's be honest] lots of games have good graphics and i kinda wonder if its just to make up for lack of creativity and plot these days i play my DS more than I play my consoles these days

I really find it strange that people say that I am being too hard on this game.  They say things like 'yea, you make some points but it's still good' but think about it!  The amount of time you invest, for nothing really interesting or original.  Yea, and I agree, it is hard to find a good original game these days but maybe if we stopped settling developers would actually make good games [and not lobby IGN with lots of $$ and other places to beef up reviews because people, this is NOT the best game to come out there].

But no one will probably read this.  But if you play it and you like it, that's great.  I am just angry that my expectations were not met. At all.

It's one of the first games I played and no doubt one of my favorites, so I was so exited for this one. Especially because High Impact Games did a good job on Ratchet and Clank Size Matters. I did not get what I expected.
  Right, so the story. All the eco in the universe is going away so Jak needs to stop it. It's actually not that bad, but not nearly as extremely EPIC as the other games. There are some twists. It may be confusing if you don't know the Jak universe. (I suggest you play games 1-3 and don't buy this)
  The gameplay is split into 3 sections. First is running around with Jak and shooting things and platforming. It's alright. The weapons get WAY too weak later in the game. You can't have Dark Jak or light Jak, instead you have Blue, green, Red, and yellow eco powers. There are still a little fun, but not as awesome as the others.
  Second is the Dark Daxter parts. in THEORY Dark Daxter seems awesome and I would be, but not how the did it. It consists of repetative mashing a button and boring puzzles. These parts are a chore.
  Finally the flying. Personally I don't like driving in games, but I loved the driving bits in Jak 2 and 3. If you like flying, you'll probably like it. It's not that bad. BUT, if you don't like driving and/or aren't realy good at it prepare for all heck to break loose. I spent sooooo long trying to get past some of the latter driving. They are so annoying. Argh... even some other parts are annoying like this ape boss thing that is almost impossible!
  You can upgrade your ship and powers. If you do end up getting this for some weird reason then upgrade alot. Even then it can still be annoying. Jak 2 was hard, but....

To Ground Control's credit, this is probably the  best 3D land-based RTS game to come out yet. However, it still doesn't  manage to escape from a lot of the shortcomings of its fellow 3D  RTS's.
The nature of 3D RTS, at least so far, seems to be that units are  more 'realistically' proportional to the terrain. While that may be nice on  paper, in gameplay what it translates to is that you spend hours moving  your units from one place on the map to the other, because they're so small  in proportion to the terrain. In fighting battles, you're obligated to zoom  out to such an extent that each unit is only a blip of a few pixels on your  screen--not much fun to watch or look at while directing the troops.
I  don't find the elimination of resource management to be a plus for Ground  Control. What that ends up meaning is that there is no reinforcement  available for you to build or buy; you can't simply play and have fun if  you want to try different things in a mission. You have to carefully and  tediously position your units so as to incur as few losses as possible. Add  to this the fact that there is NO in-game saving in Ground Control, and you  find yourself playing very carefully and tediously indeed.
Topping this  off, there just isn't a good story happening here to keep you interested.  It's mostly told through the thoughts of the two side commanders rather  than through good character and dialog. The cutscenes are hands-down the  worst I've ever seen--they are videos of the game engine, it looks like,  and they're so badly compressed that they look like they're being streamed  over the web--blocky, blurry, and awful to watch.
On the positive side,  the game does look great, especially when you zoom in close to the units  fighting. It plays better on lower-end systems than other games of its  type, but you'll still need a blistering machine if you want to see it in  its full glory.
Be warned also that it's not entirely stable. A patch was  released the day after it hit retail, but not all of the bugs are out of  it. One of the worst is that it will crash on completion of a mission, and  you don't get credited with the mission. I've spent more hours replaying  because of this than I'd care to admit.
As a former Army officer, I think  there are some cool tactical things happening in Ground Control that  haven't been modeled well in other games--friendly fire, fire support,  formations--but in the end, when all is said and done, I have to say that  the game just isn't that much fun to play.

2.  Combat is either too easy or too hard.  In one section at the end, you get continuously beset by monsters, and the only way to move forward is to ignore them and get to a set of controls.  If you try to fight them all, you will die from the multiple combined-arms attacks from all directions at once.  In the rest of the game, you get 4-6 normal type bad guys, then you look for items, then you move to the next section.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Dull.  Then again, you could bang your head into the keyboard for every time you die because the game won't jump over a wall, instead pulling you out of cover.  Facing is too important, and gets you killed all too often, even under cover.  Also, powers are blocked by the cover you're standing behind far too much.  It's a headache.

3.  Lack of sidequests.  You can't land on a planet in most cases, so there's nothing to explore.  No stores to shop from except on the Citadel.  What good are the credits for?  Not much.  I had over 300K of credits when I finished the game, and the top-level weapons in the Spectre armory were less powerful than the other weapons you pick up along the way.  Nothing to do, and nothing to see, except planet stat sheets.  Not very exciting.  All you do is to go to each planet, ping the planet, and see if something comes up.  If Reapers come out, you have to leave and do a real mission before you can go in the system again without Reapers coming to kill you.  Getting 100% of a system searched gains you nothing, as most of the completion comes from derelict ships full of fuel (and nothing else).

4.  The use of an old, tired stereotype in Kei Lang.  The chinese ninja-type.  If you didn't read the books (and I didn't), then you have no choice but to assume that the writers are stereotyping like mad.  Am I the only one up in arms about this?  I hope not.  I would have preferred any nationality except that tired old cliche.  And the bastard is too powerful in his final boss fight.  I would have preferred a real one-on-one fight similar to God of War for that fight.  Too much crossfire makes for major headaches and cursing when you die because you're surrounded despite being in cover.

4.  For being in relationships in ME1 and ME2, you sure don't see a lot of closeness in ME3.  It feels like there's no relationships at all, which was the main point of ME1 and ME2 - the stuff you do carries forward through every game.  This was a major letdown, and lost a lot of emotional energy from the story.

5.  Whatever happened to the complete database of galactic history and species from the previous two games?  If someone picked up ME3 without playing the other two, they lose out on everything ME veterans already know (like the Elcor verbalizing emotions because of lack of facial expressions).  Again, it's a loss of depth of the vast ME universe, and the games loses emotion energy because of it (you can't dig into what isn't there).

6.  THE ENDING SUCKED.  I can't put it any clearer without cursing my head off.  If the endings were the payoff for the game, this game was a total ripoff.  It seemed as if EA fired the entire writing staff just prior to writing the ending of the game, and they hired two idiots to finish it off.  The choice you're given at the end has almost no effect at all - only one small thing changes, and that has to do with EDI being in the ending or not.  That's it.  No other differences.  And the ending is beyond cheesy.  It brings no closure to the ME universe, nor to the other main characters.  If I had known the ending would have sucked so bad, I would NOT have bought the game.  It takes everything that went before in the other games and desecrates it all.  And the fate of the Normandy makes no sense whatsoever, considering the physics that the ME universe uses (and discusses at length in the previous two games).

I'm sure I could come up with more negative points to make, but if you're still masochistic enough to consider buying the game by this point, it's on you.

Overall:  Don't buy this game.  Make EA fix the damn thing first.  Don't subject yourself to the boredom and frustration for such a scummy ending.  It's not worth it.  :(","Story is the best point, but spectacularly fails at the end.",1332374400,11,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The economy requires you to buy gil for real money if you want to pay for something.  Otherwise, expect countless countless countless hours trying to raise money to repair weapons, buy new ones, keep your armor updated etc, completely distracting you from the game itself, which is apparently only a footnote, or an excuse to make players run around endlessly trying to get new weapons and armor.
Combat is ridiculously easy.  Group combat is rediculously hard, if you could have a pet squirrel that did a 1hp bite attack, he would randomly get aggro even if you waited till the end of the fight to let him in on the action.
The game itself seems so SMALL.  The world is really tiny.  Outdoor areas are in cramped spaces that are surrounded by an open looking backdrop to make the the player feel like he is in an expansive environment, but really is caged in like a hamster in this tiny little place.

The enemies are your standard slew if crap Konami throws into things recently to scream ""this is silent hill,"" since all they seem to go for us brand recognition even when it goes against game lore and logic. Nurses and those dumb bladed things from Homecoming are ~90% of what you'll see.

They tried to blend Diablo with survival horror elements which ends up basing bizarre and frustrating. Weapons will break, even giant flaming swords which is a thing in silent hill now apparently. All supplies are fairly limited. Once you get into the higher levels you'll just stay aggravated. Survival horror elements just don't work in a dungeon crawler where you HAVE to fight things.

Ignore the hilarious amount of padding and plastic that has been wasted on a cheap case for games.  Ignore the shape of the case, which for some reason suggests that it will hold a system above the molded plastic, ala the PDP Custom Crystal Case.  This is ONLY a case for the games.

When I received it in the mail, I thought someone had pulled a prank on me.  Based on the sparse information in the product description, I expected to get a cheapy, no-frills clamshell case for the PlayStation Vita.  After all, none of these pictures shows the Mad Catz Armor GameCase to scale, and the bullet points about the product mention fitting games and memory cards in molded plastic in much the same way that full cases for the Vita do.  Why they bothered to make the case look like a case for the system itself is beyond me.  As is, it's effectively sturdy for holding 6 Vita game cards at a reasonable price, but it's also considerably bulky (it's about half the size of the Vita but thick as game card cases go), a waste of plastic, and the moldings don't release the games as easily as you'd want.

Perhaps I made a boneheaded error, but with the scarcity of information available about this item, I don't feel particularly stupid for making that mistake.

This game is terrible compared to 3d platforming excellence like Jak & Daxter or Sly Cooper.  Considering how much precision the game requires, the lack of practical precision the game gives you in the controls is infuriating (more on that later).  The camera is awful, constantly having to be managed by you to get anywhere, and it DOES NOT SEE THROUGH WALLS.  I cannot believe how pissed the camera made me, giving me a fullscreen of wall during times requiring precision.  Oh, and the ""B"" button is both the talk and dive button, so if you were trying to talk to someone, but the talk context icon didn't pop-up quick enough, prepare to enjoy flinging yourself off cliffs.  Mario also does not respond well to surfaces he can wall jump or slide on;  If you hit the wall too smoothly for example, he won't wall-slide down it, he'll simply fall straight down as if there's no wall at all.  If you are falling downwards, it's extremely difficult to fall only a little bit forward, you often wind up overshooting your mark because the controls don't allow for fine movement unless you move the joystick at .1 mm at a time.  When you are dealing with disappering blocks, you don't have time for that kind of fine movement, but anything more than that ultrafine joystick movement sends mario running too far.

The game also almost never tells you what you are supposed to do next, nor does it give any hints.  I've had to consult a FAQ many times simply because I didn't understand what I had to do next in a mission, or even where I had to go to get to the next ""world"".

The most important jump in the game, the 180 degree high jump, also does not reliably work.  If you are moving in one direction, your jump height is actually kind of small.  In order to get decent air, you have to move in one direction for a half second, and then do a 180 and move the other direction and press jump.  Problem is, this jump does not reliably happen.  It works most of the time, but again it is extremely frustrating when it doesn't work at key moments, and you wind up doing a crappy normal jump instead.

Another, more minor quibble is that there is no option to invert/un-invert the camera y-axis or x-axis.  Nintendo chose to make the camera inverted, and you're stuck with it.  I got used to it after 2 hours, but man was it annoying.  How hard is it to program camera inversion???

As soon as you turn it on you have to suffer through a stupid long and boring message dribbling on about this is only a video game and the prizes are to be in no way considered real.... REALLY? You know, for years now, when i won money on a video game, i have been sending in a lot of complaints that I never received my check in the mail. I must be owed the entire planets weekly income times 100 by now. Remind me to send another complaint about not receiving my Price Is Right Prizes for this game.

Finally you get to start your game. You can chose to either play a 1 player game against the computer, or a party game which just means 1 to 4 players using the same DS. No WIFI game to chose? ... oh well, that makes sense I guess.

Then you get to choose your well thought out and brilliantly designed contestants that consist of a fat red neck woman, a limp wristed blond guy, a little old lady and the ever so popular army man, or general, or some dork everyone was screaming out to be a selectable character for a video game. But even worse, these are your only 4 to chose from, they really should have come up with something a lot better then these 4 sorry sacks of polygon.

So, into the game. You start off with 4 contestants, and quite remarkably, it's the same 4 all the time, it's the same 4 you get to chose as your character, imagine that! Ratings for this show would be through the roof every week seeing these four returning all the time.

So you get to see a picture of something to guess the price of it. They could have chose something more then grainy pictures as the prize to bid on, cause it always look like something you wouldn't pay 50 cents for, but everyone else bids around $1500 for it, so you enter your bid and if you win, you win and go to play the next showcase. If you lose, you get a strike and play the next showcase anyway.

Then you play 1 round of something from the show, some of them are ok to play, and some are damn right boring. But there is about 10-15 i dunno, could be 20 games to play all up. Then if you win you go to the big wheel, and if you dont, you get a strike and go to the big wheel anyway. And then either you or the computer spins to get closest to a dollar, and this thing you probably would expect you could either spin the wheel lightly or hard, to have a random chance of what number it falls on... but no, tap it lightly, or drag the stylus as fast as you can, it don't matter, it's going to spin and the same speed anyway. Which does not exactly make it fair as you let the computer decide what numbers your going to get.

Then if you win, you go onto the last round, and you see some more grainy pictures and bid how much ya think it's worth. Who knows, cause the game claims a couple of grainy pictures of chicks in bikinis are worth $37,000 and I got it way off by bidding 1 cent. Man, I could have sworn it was going to tell me I was correct. I usually just let the computer make it's bid and then bid the exact same number. Got a 50/50 chance of it working, but there's only a 40% chance of that.

If you lose, you go back to the opening round to bid on some more pixolated girls with grainy smiles holding a cane with a clock attached to it. In which there is no point playing, cause if you get it wrong, its your 3rd strike and game over, so you start again and play that same round with a new stupid picture of a toilet roll with iceypole sticks through it and a lady smiling and taunting you like, ""you have no idea what this prize even is, so how can you get the price correct""

So overall, i'd say if this game could show you a picture of itself, and say the item says 10 dollars, and should you bid higher or lower, i'd say bid much lower. Other wise you will feel you got ripped off.

The game is good for about 10 hours. Then you start to realize the shortfalls. The game is very repetitive. Mine. Craft. Sell.
The people you meet all look the same from 3 different models. The caves are the same. The planets all seem the same (they may have different environments but that's about it).

So far the big goal here is to get a ship (which they're all the same in the way they handle) that has enough slots to store the stuff you mine so you can sell it or craft it.

You pretty much need a guide to find items such as access passes that allow you to go to different areas to find other stuff to add to your inventor to sell or mine.

Given enough cash (from selling stuff that you mine) you pretty much complete this part of the game by buying bigger ships or more slots in your suit.

Like I said. After a while you will simply wonder what's the point and move on to something else.

Pros
Combat never really gets too boring as you can change the way you fight as you level up. Can be repetitive though.
Voice acting(especially if you take the sarcastic approach on the wheel)
Character building an impactful story for later on. Spoiler free, you'll want to collect the SAM fragments and enjoy that. But there a ton of loose ends that were left open either for DLC or for a sequel. The choices never impact you right away but do later on. The epilogue is totally weak.

Negatives
Story is too thin and never really grabs you. Some of the side quests have better writing and the main quest is just kind of filler, which is odd.
Awkward animations and they get worse in the emotional scenes and really can impact it.
Crafting system is awkward and clumsy, and while you do get the hang of it, it just never is fun.

Overall the game just lacks story and the final mission is pretty anticlimatic and the fact you can't explore is a let down.  The NOMAD is wonky and needs upgraded as quick as you can.

There's some bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking that I experienced. Overall the game feels like Star Ocean without the mystery. The private actions (scenes in the rooms on the Tempestt) are way more entertaining than the main quest. I tried to be as spoiler free as possible, but if you have questions you can ask and I'll be happy to answer.
The voice acting is good, the animations are worse for Sara, not sure why but they are, I won't harp on the graphics, as what I loved about the series is the story but you can look at most reviews to see they are weird. The game takes a bit to get going but it never really lifts off like the past three story wise.

 Like most true open world RPGs there is more emphasis on exploring than story, but when you have no reason to explore it quickly becomes boring,  since Skyrim, games have pushed thin stories and open worlds with no barriers. And like most since the story is spread thin to try to keep you engaged but it just doesn't. To really tell a story like this putting it on a branching path with limited access to exploration would have made sense. It just doesn't keep you engaged enough to plow through the awkward moments and the weird crafting system.

It's a bummer but this just feels like a space baby of Skyrim and Witcher 3 with less story.  Rent it to test it before you buy this one, because it is a fresh start for the series, just feels they left the emotional impact and what made the first three great.

The presentation overall is great. Voice acting is good, sound is good. The gameplay feels smooth, that aside, I was very underwhelmed by this game.

I'll give you the rundown on just about every scene you'll encounter: ""Hey, that's what we need, way over there! We'll have to figure out how to get to it"" Then it's climb, climb, climb. Oh, hey there's a place you needed to solve a puzzle (that nobody would ever take the time to make) just to get into, and turns out there's a group of bad guys. Climb, shoot a few bad guys. Climb some more. Oh, and then a cut scene where everything breaks and you're way high up and Nate almost falls to his death but hangs on with one arm, and then gameplay resumes and you have to climb back up. After about 20 times of that, it loses its impact.

The story was a bit weak. It was more about the relationship between Nate and his brother (who was never even mentioned, at all, until this game, and now is a core character) and of course you have the obligatory tough female character in Nadine who is shoe horned into every movie and game these days.

In addition to the constant climbing, and I mean constant. If you play this, look at the end of the game, at your statistics, and compare the distance ran, time spent running, swimming, and climbing. You do so much climbing in this game it's ridiculous. And then there are WAY too many sections where you either give a boost to your companion, or it's too high and you have to drag a box over and jump on it (like in The Last of Us)

The AI is painfully stupid. The ""stealth"" elements are incredibly weak and you can literally jump and land right next to an enemy and they won't notice you. However, if you're hiding and throw a grenade or something anywhere in the area, they'll all immediately know exactly where you are.

Also, admittedly, I'm used to playing co-op in more combat-heavy RPG formats (DIablo III, Dungeon Siege 3), so this game was a bit of a departure.

Pros: Yes, it has beautiful graphics. I'm glad to see so many people blown away by them, but they don't impress me all that much. Another pro is switching between characters during gameplay, which was very necessary during co-op play.

Cons: MONOTONOUS. Almost every single puzzle we encountered in our (co-op) hour of playing this game involved the wizard creating a box and moving it around. Somehow this is supposed to require creativity and be interesting? Hmmm. We found that one of us pretty much always had to stay the wizard for each level to create and manage our boxes to beat the puzzles. Also, the thief and wizard characters are weak when it comes to combat and die quickly. The wizard has no defense whatsoever, and the thief has a hard-to-wield/shoot bow. The controls for the weapons on the characters are not intuitive, and require a lot of effort in terms of aiming, etc. Characters die easily. Many a death occurred when one of our characters accidentally landed on spikes. Also, I'm not really sure why you need a thief given that in most of the levels so far, her skillset has been useless (grappling, shooting bows).

To be fair, we've only played this game about an hour so far, but I'm unimpressed, and am confused as to why so many people love this game when it feels like the solution to every puzzle is box creation and/or to float someone on top of the box to get somewhere. This game is not very intuitive weapon/control-wise and to me, it feels like the creative team spent way more time on the graphics than the puzzles or the characters.

However, within a month, I noticed an odd issue. Occasionally, an extra letter would show up in what I was writing. In video games, sometimes I would lose control of my character.

I think they're one of the best game series ever produced. The action sequences, the look of the game, the attention to detail, the recreation of historic times made me want to go and read the real history of the times covered by this series. I loved the side missions and attaining a goal so as to beat puzzles and get into the fantastic cut sequences. All first rate.

Then they came out with AC3. I am presently near the end of sequence 7 of the game and I have to say I find this game tedious and overly busy with cut sequences and difficult. Where I could inhabit the worlds of the previous games of the series, happily wandering around enjoying the little side missions, with this one I just want to get through it and finish it. I have been stuck for weeks at the Battle of Bunker Hill, but I get so bored with it, I get killed.....again, turn the Xbox off and go and do something else then some time later try again.

Where's the set up for the assassination?, the planning of the kill?, the escape strategy? the continuation of the back story? As an Australian who has been to Boston I must say I do enjoy walking the streets of colonial bean town, I just wish it had a better game to play in it.

I do hope the 4th in the series is better than this one.

I write a few months on from the above. After having left this game I came back to it and managed to get a few more Sequences along, but I can't say it has improved and unlike all the previous titles of this series (which I still have) it will be traded in unfinished and I'll be glad to be rid of it. Any enjoyment is just too dominated by the frustration of the appalling game play and I took the advice of another reveiwer here and watched the cut scenes on you-tube.

In addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long.

In part, that is what I got - chocobos, red mages, black mages, the general look and feel was that of an FF game. The game, however, wasn't well designed for console use. Having played originally on the PC (and yes, Play Online is a great reason to avoid this title - you deserve a certificate of achievement, or at least an achievement, in just installing and running this game), the console version brought many mutes to the world - it's very difficult to communicate through the standard controller, and somewhat frustrating to interact/combat the world.

The game has a crafting system that was so complicated and poorly implemented, that I didn't even bother on my first play - I only gave it a serious look on the console, once the world became a somewhat barren wasteland, devoid of new players. Like most of the rest of the game, it was boring and unproductive.

There are a handful of random mini/sub-story encounters that I really liked, however, there were too few of these, and they were far too short. Most newer games have these mini-quests as a standard these days.

The achievements in this game likely require months to acquire even one of them. Most are simply to reach max level in a class - not an easy (nor fun) task.

Ultimately this game is dated, and boring. Regardless of sales price, having to setup and maintain a monthly payment for this game is a joke.

It seems to stay on a long time, even after I took apart my PS3, cleaned it out with compressed air, did the self-cleaning fan test, and vacuumed it out. I've been keeping it clean with compressed air but decided to do a deep clean since I was getting over-heating issues. It would get especially hot when playing disc games. The fans would kick into highest gear, and the game would freeze.

This product is pretty cool with it's heat sensor that automatically kicks the fans on, usually when the PS3's own fans kick in to a higher level. At first, I was getting an annoying wearing sound from the cooling station. I took the PS3 out and turned the fans on. I noticed that one of them was kind of loose. I turned it off, and felt that one of the fans was not as snug as the other. I gently nudged it into place, and no more annoying whirring sound! I can feel the hot air being blown out of the fans, but it doesn't feel like it blows it directly away from the system. They seem kind of weak. The system's fans stay on for a long time, and the unit still feels hot. This leads me to believe that the cooling station is helping, but not alleviating the problem completely.

I will keep using this product probably until I upgrade to a PS4 or replace my PS3. In the future, I'd like to try a laptop cooling pad as I've read that these help the move heat away from the bottom of the PS3, which is where a lot of heat seems to get trapped. I've also heard that placing the unit vertically helps keep it cooler.

I wouldn't spend more than 25 bucks for this product, so don't buy it at 30. Wait for it to go down. And inspect the fans and listen for any odd noises. Return the product if it keeps making noise, because it should actually run pretty smooth and quiet.

UPDATE: 1/10/16. So after a year and almost a half of using this product, it has failed. One of the fans makes a LOUD grinding noise. The other one just makes that audible but negligible whirring sound. The failing fan makes it so I have to replace it because it is either constantly loud, or randomly every three seconds interrupting what I am watching.

Sanges,"Bought these shortly after Christmas, and upon reading of the horrors of setting them up I found out myself just how heinous a process it is. Even after fighting for over a half-hour for the clamps that hold the cymbal posts to the drum kit to ""JUST...SNAP...JUST...SNAP..C'MONNNNNNNN SNAAAP!! GAAAUGH! %&#@!"" with and without powertools (one of which never fully did snap 100% together), they worked beautifully, truly adding a new dimension and surprisingly seemed to make drumming a little easier for this non-musician to do-it-up more like a real one. Infatuated, I played for hours everyday for about a week straight before getting distracted from playing for that entire next week after.

The start of having these cymbals for that third week... was every optimistic-cynic's nightmare. Having known about the terrible setup, and still choosing to trudge on. Then experiencing the setup, and still going forward from that. Then experiencing a blissful 7-days of newfound drumming glory... to suddenly having DOUBLE-HIT!??

For no obvious, apparent, or investigative reason, my cymbals started double hitting any moderately-hard hit they registered. Which, if you do your homework, a lot of the disgruntled reports over these cymbals are about. If you just want to play and don't care about your score (and your score multiplier) then you won't care that this seems to be an unfixable and common problem with these.

But I, for one, also am now hanging my head low in mourning of what-was for a beautiful 7-day stretch, and what-could've been with properly designed cymbal accessories.

[PS.  Also, feel free to assume that it's just me and my cymbal pack (and dozens of others out there) and trudge onward with your purchase! Best of luck to you, honestly, because they're sadly a great addition.]

***EDIT #2: Originally I had posted an edit about how I attempted to take mine apart and found that it was missing necessary wiring so that it could never be fixed, well apparently those first few pages I found about fixing these cymbals were wrong, or else I just didn't know exactly what to look for in the guts of my broken cymbal that kept double-tapping in-game. After peeling off and realigning the wire and ""stickum"" to the proper place that they weren't in the first place to where they belonged, this double-cymbal pack only gave me problems with how the vice grip holders that wouldn't ""SNAP!"" would eventually drop my cymbal posts and I'd have to pause mid-song to readjust them--but this was very rarely, or only after extended disuse.

I've owned Logitech keyboards that can handle my rough treatment well (I'm hard on the equipment - First Person Shooter gamer).  I've had this G510 gaming keyboard for a couple of years and it's still holding up surprisingly well.  So when I went to replace my headset I decided to give the Logitech G35 a try.  It seemed to do well in the tech rag reviews and the price wasn't bad.

Couple/three things.
First, the wireless unit has no weight to it so you will need to tape it or weight it down to prevent it falling over if you or something snags either of it's two cables (one to the computer, one to the headset).  The falling over is a problem because the actual ""wireless"" unit is about like a flash drive and just sits in a slot in the base unit and can jar loose or fall out of the base.
Second, unless you're disciplined (use the unit, then plug it in for charging), you'll probably run out of battery life.  If you wish to stay at the computer you will need to plug the charging cable into the headset.  Unfortunately the cable to headset connection setup isn't all that robust and within a couple of months I had worn out enough that it only made a solid connection intermittently.
Third, at least on my head, the earcovers began to hurt a little after a couple of hours when glasses are worn.
Fourth, the headset mounted on/off switch is a joke.  Only worked intermittently since day one.
Otherwise the unit is comfortable, seems to be well built and sounds excellent (7.1 surround).

Like most games now, the graphics are very nice and the music is cheesy.  It sounds more self indulged by the composer and subsequently doesn't work.

The control in this game is the worst element though.  The simple task of aiming a crosshair is nothing short of slow torture.  It's a constant frustration that doesn't improve even as you progress since the enemies get harder and come in greater numbers.

On top of the poor control the main character (Lazarus) is a unbearable, idiot.  We are constantly having to endure his stupid one liners and conflicted rebel attitude through out the game.

Nevertheless, that hasn't been said all the time with the way they've been conjured as video game counterparts. With constants on the Playstation 2 like Wheel Of Fortune and Jeopardy proving their definitive status in gaming for years, many people have wanted another classic on the video game market. Family Feud has also been one of those shows as well. This past year, the show celebrated its 30th anniversary, and a new host as well, John O' Hurley. Now, it is on the video game market, but does it realy match what the survey said.

Family Feud for the Playstation 2, tries to deliver one of the greatest shows of all time to the video game market. The game features over 1,000 questions that match your integrity to what typically 100 people said. The game however handles well visually, and there are a lot of extras to unlock like sets from previous editions of the shows going all the back to when Richard Dawson hosted the show in the late 70's and early 80's. Unfortunately, there are a lot of flaws with this version. One flaw is that it sometimes has to be exact when your giving a right answer. If you give a similar answer in word, that might register as a strike by mistake. Another disadvantage is that the game doesn't feature John O' Hurley as the host and voiceover. Instead, Todd Newton from GSN's Whammy!: The All New Press Your Luck is the emcee in this version. Although he handles well in the voice, the gameplay misses out.

All in all, if you're a fan of Family Feud, I really don't recommend that you get this game. Instead, why don't you get it for the computer, or download it off the website, iwin.com, which brrings out more fun to the legendary game show. If you don't have a computer either, and only a Playstation 2, than this would be considered as just a rental, and that is the #1 answer.

Stellar graphics, seemless transition from movie to game, imaginative level design, excellent two player strategy, a level system for special attacks, etc.  Therefore, I was excited to play Prince Caspian.

I think there are a few things that ruin this game.  First is it not being linear.  Each level is open-ended.  Each stage is broken down into different areas that are re-accessible over and over again.  Items re-appear and you are asked with a prompt if you'd like to re-do the area.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea.

Second, most of the game is just finding the missing lever so that you can re-attach it to the crank.  There is an over-abundance of crank pulling, which takes 5 seconds or more of button mashing to complete.

Third, there are no special attacks. In the first game you were allowed to level up and earn special attacks.  Characters now are limited to three attacks or less, with very little variation. Lucy cannot even use her cordial to heal, Susan does not use the pan flute or the horn, etc.

Fourth, there are 20 or more playable characters in this game.  You cannot choose the character you want at any given time, but are limited to whatever characters they give you in each stage. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play as the main characters and not as a tree, centaur, or Caspian's tutor.

Fifth, Huge Battles play out in the background.  They are just eye candy.  You can stand in the middle of a huge battleground and never be hurt.  The game is easy.  Involving button mashing to get through.

Sixth, missions are boring.  More crank turning and many  things in the game were not in the movie at all.

Seventh - The first game featured cast interviews and other interesting extras and movies.  This game lacks in that department.

The problem with this game was that there wasn't much to the movie or the book, so they didn't have much to work with in the first place; however, it could have still been a great game, if it played like the first.

I'm a big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, but this game is nothing more than button mashing, crank turning, and major character hopping with characters I had no desire to be.  I recommend the first Narnia game over this one any day.

In short, I think the drawbacks of this mouse outweigh the benefits, especially given its high price relative to other gaming mice.

First, the ambidextrous design is in my opinion, a mistake. While the design may benefit Razer, who can market the same mouse to both right-handed and left-handed gamers, the design fails to ergonomically benefit either a right-hand or left-hand gamer because it doesn't fit comfortably with either hand. There is no curve to support either hand's resting position, and there is no thumb support so your thumb just drags along.

Second, the optical tracking isn't very smooth for the price. I use a Logitech MX Master as a gaming mouse. The smoothness and precision of its tracking is far superior to this Razer mouse even though the MX isn't designed specifically for gaming like the Razer. Although the MX is more expensive than the Razer, the Razer is still an expensive mouse, and I expected better performance from a mouse specifically marketed as a gaming peripheral.

Lastly, Razer intentionally does not ship the Chroma with drivers. I've been a PC gamer for a long, long, time. The intentional omission of drivers for a product like this was a first for me. Who spends this kind of money on a mouse and doesn't expect drivers made readily available during installation? I thought OK, I'll just download them from the Razer website. Not so fast apparently. Once you locate them on the Razer site (not so easy in itself) you must first register with a verified email to even be allowed to download the drivers. Then, when you dig a bit further, you learn that you must have an internet connection to even install the drivers, and after installation, the drivers will always be connected to the internet. Most gamers still rail against PC games that requires an ""always on"" connection to play a purchased game. I was confounded that Razer would try to do something similar with drivers, although they claim that after registration and installation you can finally use your mouse ""off-line."" Why does a mouse need to be connected on-line in the first place?

The lighting on the mouse is impressive, however, and it lights up and shimmers with color like the Vegas strip at night. But I buy a gaming mouse to game more efficiently, not for a light show. I like having the option, but I feel like Razer lost sight of the true purpose and focused more attention on the lighting design at the cost of more important features like ergonomics (and drivers.)

Why anyone would want to play the same storyline twice is beyond me.  The AI is truly stupid.  On the GDI side, just amass a large group of Orca bombers and you can obliterate anything, and on NOD side, you can pretty much Sub APC engineers and steal all your enemy's buildings and easily defeat them.  I finished the add-on in one day.  The add-on is that pathetic.
 The Add-on is centered on one thing, DESTROY CABAL.  Now, I happen to think that CABAL is pretty kewl, especially when you are working with him.  But now you have to destroy him twice in both campaigns.  One of the new units, the Reaper, you do not get to build or create which is pretty much useless.  And in the last mission on NOD campaign, CABAL attacks you with both NOD and GDI units.  The computer always has to cheat doesn't it?  The game play is still unbalanced and you can whiz thru most missions like a breeze.
 I don't recommend this unless you are really bored and want to play thru 9 missions on both sides that follow the same storyline.  I truly hope Red Alert 2 will be a improvement.  I really don't think anything can top the storyline in the orginal Command and Conquer.",Westwood just wants more of your money...,969840000,3,,

The football.

The football is okay.  It isn't great, but it is good, and on par with recent releases of Madden.  There are things which are interesting, and things that will drive you nuts.  I got tired of the run-off that happened before each play, outside of the final two minutes of the half(s).

Player Modelling.

I don't know who decided it would be funny to make all the big men - O-line, D-line - look like overstuffed water balloons, but I didn't care for it.  It looks retarded.

The Franchise.

For many of us, this is the reason we buy Madden.  The Franchise is lackluster in this incarnation of Madden.  There are a few neat ideas, but they have been executed poorly.  There are expanded pre-season rosters, and cut days, but they are very arbitrary. You can make the cuts,  then go sign a F/A and you don't need to cut again.  Also the menu is not really to my taste, I like having it up instead of needing to call it up, but that is a personal preference.
I think it is a GREAT idea to have the overall player rating uncertain, but basic measurables that remain a mystery?  I guarantee, every team knows how fast each player on the team is, for example.  This needs some tweaking.  There are measureables that make sense to keep unsure - awareness, ZCV MCV, etc...  But speed, strength, jumping?  These are quantites teams know.
Scouting within the franchise is also broken.  4 weeks of scouting over a whole season?  And all you get is +big hit, +stiff arm?
That isn't a feature, that is BROKEN.  Why am I paying a scouting agency to tell me things I could find out by watching college football for 20 minutes some Saturday?  You pay scouts for in-depth research on players.

The game as a whole.

I have one of them new fancy black x-box with built in wi-fi and hundreds of gigs of storage.  So I install all games I play.  This game still likes to hang coming in and out of menus, and weird places that you would think aren't particularly intensive.  They will probly fix this with a patch eventually, but how do you drop the ball like this and ask for 60 bucks to have the honor of gold testing a game?

The overall.

If you haven't bought a Madden in several years, you might like this, it may be the jump forward you have been hoping for.  But be smart, rent this on first, because odds are REALLY good you might think this won't be worth the 15 dollars you will be able to get it for used in a few weeks.","Rent this one, to see if you like it first...",1315180800,13,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'm not sure what the developers were thinking when they got rid of the blazing moves, the ability to adapt styles and create new combos, and the ability to interact with the enviroment i.e. banging someones head into a car and causing damage or picking up a pool stick and crackin someone on the head with it. They replaced it with ""hazards"" that never change, so all you have to do is memorize where they are and throw your opponent into it. The fighting is extremely slow and the moves are no longer crazy in a good way, instead they're pretty lame.. just kick and punch nothing flashy at all. The DJ controls this game boasts about are only ok at best. While I think the idea was good, it was poorly executed. Lucky for us we got this on PS3, the guys who got it on the 360 are seriously hurting due to poorly mapped controls. This might be an ok game for those who hadnt played the previous ps2 versions, since they wouldnt know what was missing. But if your like me, getting the game because you liked the other two, then your going to be really disappointed. When is PS3 gonna come out with a real game worth buying?

The first two GH games were incredibly fun, you could play with friends and family, and laugh and have a ball while you tried to make it through the songs. You didn't have to be musically inclined or even a video game expert to play Guitar Hero, you just had to enjoy music.

Then, you had GH3 which cranked up the difficulty and alienated some of the hardcore yet casual fans. The focus seemed to be geared towards mastering the plastic guitar controller. Some songs, I couldn't complete on the ""hard"" level and bombed out after the first 30 seconds.

The iterations following GH3 have had many improvements, culminating with the excellent GH Metallica.

Despite seeing that many songs/artists on GH5 were not any that I've heard of before, cared for, and didn't belong on a GUITAR HERO game (Coldplay??), I bought it mainly for what I thought would be an awesome Guitar Hero Van Halen (SORELY mistaken!). I am trading in GH5 now while there is still some trade-in value left. The game is OK, but really, aside from the songs and unlockables, plus the ability to use your XBox Live Avatar as a playable character, there is nothing new about this game.

Guitar Hero should be about power-chord, feel-good songs like ""Working For The Weekend"" from Loverboy (how about ""Hot Girls In Love""?), but they tried to go with the mainstream here, and I think it sucked, much like today's music sucks.

Some of the songs from popular musicians are OK to play. Figured I'd give it a try, but honestly, if you paid full price for this game, you paid too much.

I'm really disappointed with this game. I preordered it months in advance and got the CAS Demo early. I've also owned every Sims game and expansion pack since Sims 1....with that being said EA talked this game up big time! We already knew not to expect toddlers, pools or Create a Style (which was a huge disappointment) I got used to the idea of not having these features.

1.) No toddlers

It's not fun.  This isn't a game where you go to some overworld map and create storms with some sortof of recipe or agency.  You just have points to spend on storms, and you make them, one at a time, and then sit there pushing the storm towards buildings.  Back and forth with the stylus.  It's not like you make a storm and then go do something else, you have to damage as much stuff as possible to clear the level, which means driving the storm over destructible objects for the duration of the storm's life, which is about 20 seconds.
Rinse/repeat.  The 'strategy' of the title is that it gets harder to do this because repair drones come in to repair buildings, suction devices are added that eat your storms.. etc.  It's not fun.  imo, it's barely a game.

2.0,True,"02 23, 2010",A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B002673XJA,Pecos Bill,"This game is baffling.

Normally, I can tell you that Cryptic is a game company that releases a solid game engine with a good, if shallow game design.  They've never been a company that releases ""epic"" games but what they've done in the past has at least been fun with some interesting gameplay elements and decent design ideas, fully implemented.

With Star Trek Online, I can't say that.  The game is basically a wreck.  There's a good engine behind it, good artwork, some good ""look and feel"" of Star Trek but so very much of this game is poorly designed, poorly thought out and apparently hastily thrown together in ways that often make no sense.  Whoever designed this game should, for their own good, go back to whatever they were doing previously and never be allowed near game design again.  What they have done here is simply terrible.  There's probably a law against what they have done here.

The skills are a mess.  At some point they're going to have to sit down and redesign them.  The skill system itself isn't bad but the actual skills you can train up are poorly defined and poorly thought out.  Some of them are clearly a waste to train in.  It's like they came up with a list of 10 good skills that made sense, realized they needed a lot more than that and just threw down the first things that came to mind, whether it was a good idea or not, whether it made sense or not.

Federation gameplay is not very well thought out.  You will frequently find yourself alone in your ship wasting entire legions of what should be far more powerful enemy ships.  Granted this is standard MMORPG fare (""You must kill 30 of the dangerous Bugbeasts of Blatterthorp!  Their teeth are razor sharp!  Their eyes can kill a man just by.... oh, you're back already?  Already killed all 30?  Huh.  Well nevermind then."") but it's just a bit more inexcusable to use that old formula in a game that's supposed to be Star Trek.  Yes, the Enterprise was a powerful ship but no, it never went off and killed 5 squadrons of 3 Klingon Birds of Prey singlehandedly.  You'll do this in roughly every other mission in Star Trek Online, however.  By the time you make it to level 10 you'll probably have been responsible for killing what must have been thousands of alien crewmen because you've killed so very many ships.

Basically, a good Star Trek RPG is going to have to innovate a little bit when it comes to mission design and Cryptic clearly did not do that.  They followed the usual MMORPG one-man-army hack-and-slash model and it just doesn't make sense for this setting.  The combat mechanics are fun and interesting but the actual design of the content is just....thoughtless.

And while this game has a playable Klingon faction and PvP between the Federation and the Klingons, it's very poorly designed and rampant with bugs.  Cryptic did say that Klingon content was going to be ""spartan"" but they should have said ""broken and poorly designed"".  The PvP game design actually has taken a step backwards from Champions Online, which I also find baffling.  The game makes no effort to ensure that the teams are even before starting a match; most maps are simply 5v5 deathmatches; what maps have mechanics behind them are unintuitive (just you go on and try to figure out how you can tell when a capturable point has really been captured).  Klingons themselves still have broken vendors limiting their access to gear a full 3 weeks after release.  I mean, I understand that Klingon content is ""spartan"" but you guys can't even get the VENDORS checked out and working properly after 3 weeks?  That's just terrible.

And endgame content - Cryptic's motto for game development has always been ""what do you mean, 'endgame content'?""  It's just not something they do.  I have long since come to accept that.  Normally what you do in a Cryptic game is roll 8 different characters and level them up because there's great diversity in character builds but Star Trek Online doesn't even have that.  It has no apparent endgame, you only get 3 character slots and even if you had more than 3 you probably wouldn't have much use for it.

And for all this they're talking about ""microtransactions"", using real money for in-game perks and extras and they're selling ""lifetime subscriptions"".  Hey buddy, this game isn't really even worth what I already paid for it.  I'm sure not paying more anytime soon and I doubt I'll continue my subscription into the second month, much less pay for a lifetime!  Cryptic needs to stop talking about how they're going to get more money from us and start seriously addressing why this game is so terrible and what they plan to do about it.  I don't want more videos with more voiceovers and more misrepresentation of game content.  I want to see some serious talk, and Cryptic hasn't been doing that.

Basically this game is a train wreck.

It's sophomoric.  That's the best word for it.  It's like amateur hour in there.  Totally mindless game design rushed through to completion delivering a product reminiscent of a college student who has remembered he has a 10 page paper due tomorrow after a night of heavy drinking.

Maybe it was rushed.  Maybe the designer wears his pants on his head.  I don't know what, exactly, the root cause is.  But it's terrible.  Good engine.  Good graphics and sound.

It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.
Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.

2.0,False,"04 22, 2002",ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B00005NIT9,Lord Chimp,"I desperately wanted to like this game. As a strategy RPG, Hoshigami occupies a very niche corner of the video game world. Truthfully, I'm obsessed with strategy RPGs, and I'm always eager to devour new ones (which are rare, you see). Games like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, two titles which heavily influence Hoshigami, are some of my all-time favorites. I love them for their exciting battles and elaborate character micromanagement systems.
So, when I started up Hoshigami, I was impressed. It looks pretty good (along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics), the story is interesting, and it seems intelligently designed, intricate, and difficult. I love a challenge. But I was betrayed...as I played further, Hoshigami became a chore, subject to a stupid loophole in the gameplay that made the entire thing quite ridiculous (I will explain below).
The big 'innovation' here is the RAP system. Each character has RAP points, which are consumed by executing actions (movement, attacks, etc.) I can see how a system like this could be applied to enhance the game's strategy, but something went wrong. In the end, the system only empowers certain characters to make an extra attack or move a few more spaces every turn. All that really happens is you end up pressing the button a few more times every turn, which makes already slow battles slower. Oh my. Why not just give a character more movement? More attacks?
Spells appear on little goodies called Coinfeigms. You can equip characters with Coinfeigms, and elective magic is an idea I really like. The number of Coinfeigms to be collected is very impressive, too. However, they are entirely useless. For all the game's difficulty, spells imbued in Coinfeigms are hopelessly underpowered. Further evidence that spells are completely unavailing is found in the fact that as I played through the game, none of my characters were ever slain by an enemy's spell.
In Hoshigami's polytheistic world, your characters develop skills by following a specific god and gaining powers through devotion. Devotion levels rise just like experience levels, so fighting makes you more devoted, getting you more abilities...right? Right. This was a very intriguing idea (unique skills according to different gods), but the developers messed up. Firstly, it takes forever to raise your levels. The stretches between levels are long, long, LONG. Secondly, the skills you earn with higher devotion levels are almost always useless. These two things make the game very difficult.
And I mean VERY difficult. Anyone who plays Hoshigami is sure to get slaughtered several times in the first few battles. The enemies are far more powerful than your team, and you are almost always outnumbered. Plus, if a character dies, he's dead -- resurrection only becomes possible much later in the game. Initially, I was glad for a challenge, but there is a fine line between ""challenging"" and ""morbidly frustrating""...and Hoshigami crosses that line.
The only _apparent_ way to strengthen your party is to enter the Towers of Trial, which serve as training grounds for your characters. The Towers made me want to kill myself, quite honestly. They are stunningly boring, with repetitive battle maps, monsters, and everything else. I didn't want to train in these Towers, which were degenerating my sanity, but how else could I be match for the game's ridiculously hard battles?
So I discovered the ""stupid loophole"" I mentioned above. Instead of using a full team of characters, I used just two: Fazz (the main character) and one other mercenary. My mercenary would be a dummy fighter to draw enemy attacks while Fazz did the fighting. Usually my mercenary would get killed quickly, but I could always hire a more powerful one later. Even if the mercenary survived, any experience he gained would still leave him at a level lower than another mercenary I hire, so there was no point in keeping him. The beauty of it all? Fazz accrued 99% of the experience and became a death machine. It was mildly difficult at first, but soon I was able to kill most enemies in one or two hits. It became even easier when my weapon of choice became a bow & arrow so I could kill from a distance.
Suddenly, a viciously difficult game became mindlessly easy. I must say, I don't like strategy RPGs to be ""mindless."" I pushed on to the end to see what would happen in the moderately entertaining story, but the gameplay was probably making me stupider with every battle. Granted, the fact that I could defeat 15 enemies with just two characters was somewhat amusing for a few battles, but it became very boring, very quickly. A game that is too difficult is not fun. A game that is too easy is not fun either. With Hoshigami, it's either too easy or too difficult -- either way, it's not fun.

This game is not the authentic real life war on-the-battlefield war game that all the geeks are hyping and signing the party line the company puts out.

I bought two of these games after reading the reviews and I have to say that you people don't know what you are talking about.

There is pseudo-realism and that is about it. Sure the maps are close, the look and sounds of the weapons are close and even the dialog is about right, but that is about as far as it goes.

These games fall down severely on the accuracy/authenticity in several key areas.

1. Ludicrous restriction on the tactical options available to the soldiers and the squad leaders. Some of this is bad level design, some of it is probably trying to make up for the limitations of their AI, and some of it is just plain dumb.

2. Ridiculous limitations on interaction with the environments. You cannot open doors or windows. You cannot climb fences. You cannot use the wire cutters that every paratroop carried. You cannot go under a normal barbed wire fence, which thousands of hunters do several times a day in america.

Barrels and crates don't blow up or even move when hit by a tank. You can't even climb over a low wall that some other men just went over.

Perhaps most unforgivable of all, you cannot go into a prone position or crawl. You know, the stuff they teach everyone in BASIC TRAINING!

3. The gunsights are ludicrous. The amount of creep even in a crouching position is ridiculous. If I was that shakey I'd head for the retirement home.

4. Terrible path blocking and object collision detection. Quite a few times when I had a perfect view of a target and as perfect a sight picture as you would ever want I could not hit the target no matter how many rounds I fired. In real life I would have put a round through both ears of my target.

5. Absurd size of the weapons relative to your field of vision when zoomed in. Come on folks this is ridiculously UN-authentic. There is a reason for the open sights on fast action weapons like the Thompson and other SMG weapons.

6. Really stupid scenario designs. There are several instances where you are put face to face with tanks and no tactical options except to run for enemy panzerfausts. Making this worse of course are the level designs that force you to follow a relatively linear and restricted path to said anti-tank weapons. This is completely ridiculous.

7. Poor level designs. Too many places you cannot go or step when you should be able to. Places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should. Only in EIB do you get to even blow holes in the hedges with the TNT that all paratroops carried as part of their standard pack during that theater of operations, and then only in key places and one whole scenario.

8. Situational awareness mode. Give me a break. This is supposed to substitute for the advance study done by the troops? It's not even as good as a raw topo map dump. You are chained to camera angles around key points and there are no indications of any significant type for changes in elevation and quite often the terrain features are faded out due to the choices made for the camera angle.

9. Another limiting factor is that you cannot issue movement commands to a  location you know is there but are not lined up on directly yourself and you had better be on the side away from the enemy when you issue the order. This could have been easily fixed by using some option to issue commands while in situational mode, especially if that were better done.

10. Lastly the much hyped authentic tactics. Authentic, sure, in a very introductory and watered down way, severely limited in permutations, applications and variations due to all the other limitations of the game.

By the way, I am both a veteran and an experienced programmer and I am highly disappointed with this game on both counts.

If this is the latest in realism then it shows what a sorry state the gaming industry really is in. Of course I still haven't seen AI in a commercial game yet that matched up to what I saw undergrad programmers doing in college during the 80s. We deserve better and it's not that hard to do. It's time we stopped allowing these companies to hype this stuff up like it is so great when it's all fluff like pretty pictures and sound.

Intro:

First of all, im going to say the only reason im reviewing this card this soon at all is because Amazon.com was nice enough to offer a promotion that if those who bought the wifi version PSVita between the 20th to the 25th of feb/12 you get a free PSVita 4GB Memory Card with your new device thanks Amazon.com if it weren't for you guys i woulda avoided the PSVita altogether until the prices became decent. It's a deal i couldn't resist as there's no way in hell i would ever pay $20 for a 4GB card for anything, so it will remain the only card i own until the inevitable price drop for some or all cards eventually happen.

Note: Im not a sony fanboy, i used to be back when i was like 17 years old in 2007 but lets be honest here.. thats when most sony fanboys were truly born soo yeah lol, im 21 now and matured out of the horrible sony phase and am incredibly fair, this review is to benefit the customer ""US GAMERS"" not loyal lunatics. i've owned every playstation gaming console/device from PS1 to officially now the PSVita so i do know some things i'd like to think.

Quality:

It looks to be a quality product as usual for Sony, but the fact that it's a new Proprietary Format made just for the PSVita is a major mistake on Sony's part, there really screwing over there customers by doing this. for example i have had a PSP Slim 2000 first edition and own currently a PSP 3000 MGS spirited green Edition, both with many Memory Stick Pro Duo Memory ranging from 256MB all the way up to 12GB spanning across 5-6 well priced sticks altogether. 2 of which still have a lot of space that i COULD have used for my PSVita, if it weren't for this exclusive format, costing us the customers/gamers ultimately more money out of pocket in the long run.

Sure the actual quality of the card is great, but it's not the card's quality thats in question, it's the motives behind such a choice thats extremely irritating.

Straight to the point now. would i recommend getting the 4GB or any of the overpriced PSVita memory cards? well i tell you what, if you want to play the games from the shockingly awesome launch line-up for the Vita within it's first week, then yes get the 4GB since you'll need at least 1 card to save your stuff to, other then that though AVOID buying all memory cards until they eventually reduce the price on some of the higher storage cards, its simply not worth the cash. you would be saving money simply by buying the games in stores or online like right here on amazon.com since for example my first PSVita game BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND is only 2048KB to save 1 file, going by that you'll have a lot of space to work with for more games and apps by conserving if you buy the games in stores/amazon.com in physical format rather then digital. besides as gamers collecting and looking at all the cases you bought is still pretty sweet once they start stacking up.

Space: The free card that came with the Wifi version was the 4GB Card, it's decent considering game saves will only be around 2048KB to maybe 9000KB-ish so it'll last you well in game saves if you buy the format in physical form rather then saving $5 by downloading them from PSN.

however let's be honest in general 4B is simply not enough in general, it's a good start and that's all, nothing more nothing less.

Design: It's very, very small. i was actually shocked at how tiny the card was, its more like a memory chip then a card, it's sleek looking with a decent looking design but who really cares when it'll be jammed in your PSVita for the most part anyway? still the size of the thing is rather shocking, it's the smallest memory card i've ever seen. BE CAREFUL, because it can get lost easily.

Transfer Speed/Download Speed/Upload Speed: I have not tested this yet as i have not put it in my PSVita to download anything off of the PlayStation Network since the actual memory card that came with it free along with 1 game i bought came earlier then the PSVita itself. once my device does arrive though i'll update this, im going to assume it's fast though in all 3 in spades.

Overall: In general, if your a gamer you need this plain and simple, it's very expensive all of the cards are but to start things off the 4GB is the only real choice if you wanna save your monnies. my advice, wait it out for the bigger storage cards to drop in price OR wait til' someone like Sandisk make there own cheaper 3rd party versions, which they usually do at half the cost with the same if not better quality.","PSVita Proprietary Format 4GB Memory Card...Dirty move Sony, Real Dirty.",1330646400,5,,

Like many people who played this game, I have to say that it's a pretty huge disappointment.  I ignored the relatively poor rating on Amazon and assumed that people were just being cranky about the new combat system.  I played through about 90 % of this and kept hoping for a big payoff at some point.  I finally realized that there wasn't going to be one and that I'd just wasted 30 hours of my life.  The entire game you spend running down tunnels with different wallpaper fighting incredibly monotonous battles over and over again, then watching really lame cut scenes (the characters in this FF are completely lame with impossibly to decipher motivations for what they are doing).  Especially early on, the battles are always painfully easy, but you have to fight or your characters aren't going to get enough experience and will end up underpowered (in this FF you can actually see the bad guys and can skip some of them if you want).  I don't really mind the new combat system, but it basically requires you to do nothing more than hit X a few times over and over again (unless you are fighting a boss), which makes it really boring.  There are very few city or hub areas, basically no exploration, and very little NPC interaction, which really takes all the character and flavor out of the game.  It's really more of an interactive movie than a game--but a really bad one, with boring characters with nonsensical motivations, and a story that at 90 % of the way through still seems like nonsense.

 I realize you could say that some of these criticisms apply to all Final Fantasy games (linearity, boring fights), but I liked the other FF games I played (7 and 10).  For example, the ones I've played are also very linear even though they give the illusion of freedom (even the illusion is almost entirely absent here.) Somehow though, the linearity and the monotony of the fighting here is so much worse than ever before.

 Before I leave I want to address the whole ""well it really hits its stride about 20 hours in"" thing that I always hear.  First of all, a game that takes 20 hours to hit its stride is a horrible game.  It is true that about 20 hours in (roughly 2/3rs of the way through the game I'd guess), you reach a wide open area that you are actually allowed to explore and given some freedom of movement. The only things you can do here are 1) Fight challenges against various boss type enemies (I think you win rewards) and 2) Pick up item orbs and buried treasure--I think it's possible to use a Chocobo to look for buried treasure and to reach some otherwise inaccessible treasure orbs.  I explored a fair amount, but never messed around with the Chocobos and only did a few of the challenges.  There are no NPCs (I mean literally 0 anywhere) or really anything that interesting in this area, except that, like the rest of the game, it's very nice looking.  In order to advance the plot, you have to leave this area and go back to trudging down tunnels fighting stuff.

You might even say that the part of the game everyone says ""makes the game better"" is optional, except that you probably need to explore and mess around there for a while to level your characters high enough to comfortably continue.  Clearly, this is not enough to somehow make an awful game good.

Obviously it looks amazing, but that's about all it has going for it.

Gameplay tip (since I always give one in reviews):

I grew up on Beatles music and could listen to it day and night.  I L-O-V-E it.

When this game was released we seriously thought about buying it, but decided on a trial rental first.

So very glad.

There's something rather particular to the voices of each of the Beattles that makes the average non-singer fan (such as myself) sound truly horrid when trying to sing along.

I've been playing regular Rock Band for over a year and hated myself pretty bad with that much of the time. I can't fault either game for my lack of singing skills.

However, unlike with regular Rock Band, I'm FAR more interested in singing with Beatles than I am in playing instruments. At least attempting to master the drums placated me with the 'regular' version. But being a die hard Beatles fan (and not because I wanted to beat drums like Ringo, play the guitar like George or rock the harmonica like Paul) all I want to do is sing the songs.

If you're thinking about buying this game because you REALLY love to sing along to Beatles tunes, I'd recommend you rent it first and give it a trial run.

I just got this the other day and have been trying to MAKE myself play it. That should tell you something right there.
EGM and Gamespot's reviews of this game are dead-on: It definitely feels and looks like a DC port.
Read both of those reviews.
This almost can't even be called a game, and if you go into this thinking you have another Morrowind type game on your hands, than you will be very disappointed.
Morrowind blows this thing away for epic scope, freedom, and variety. It's false advertising if anyone tries to sell this to you under that pretense.
The game is mostly you talking people and getting from point to point. It's a detective novel that you kind of interact with, for all intents and purposes.
Yes, you can sight see, buy knick knacks, find the Sega arcade games, and other side jaunts, but GTA:VC and Morrowind both FAR AND AWAY have a much greater sense of freedom and variety of gameplay than this does. It's not fair to compare such different genres, but that's what some people have been doing, and I am setting the record straight.
I think this is a niche title that fans of the first game should chew up.
For people like me, who didn't play the first one, you might be asking yourself, ""Yeah, so?""
I think that this game needed more time on the shelf.
MAKE it Xbox worthy on all levels. As it stands, it reeks of Dreamcast port all the way.
The controls leave something to be desired. They almost go down to Resident Evil level, which is disgraceful. The controls are tolerable, but that's about it.

Aesthetically I don't mind the headset at all, especially in black. It isn't going to win any awards for presentation but I think they look pretty good. The construction is solid and better than I would have expected at this price range. It doesn't feel like I can toss it around the room but I wouldn't worry about dropping them. Another point of construction is that I really love what they did with the headband but I could see it being an issue for those with larger heads. There aren't multiple settings to place it at but instead the band on the top to ease it onto your head slides up as you slide it on which makes for a very comfortable fit.

Functionally the headset is much more than I expected. I got a pair of these for myself and my brother at $24 a pop. The audio comes through perfectly clear and I tested the mic with my friends through Teamspeak and the sound is excellent. The mic is sensitive enough to pick up my voice and doesn't let too much ambient noise through. When I tried to test my mic myself though it had a sound to it almost as if I was in a small room, not quite an echo but sort of. Apparently that isn't as prominent when going straight through to my friends since I asked them and they said they didn't hear it.

The issue I mentioned with the headset comes from the wire. As soon as I pulled the out of the box I was a little worried. The wire doesn't have the standard rubber/plastic covers that they typically do but a sort of cloth braid. I have seen these before and I don't know the pros and cons, I just know that they tend to break on me and do so much sooner than standard ones do. In fact, out of the box my headset already has some wire issues. When the cable moves a certain way the audio in my left ear goes out. It makes me very sad because outside of that, these $24 headsets out perform any headset I have purchased under $70. The wire issue will only grow worse over time because that is just what happens to wires but I really wish that one issue had been taken care of so I could give these headsets the rating they would otherwise deserve. I only knock two stars off for one issue because that one issue turns these into paper weights depending on severity.

If you want a fair price (even under priced) headset for gaming or general computer use then I still recommend these. Just be warned that the wire issue may cut your time with them short.

UPDATE! 4/26 So I mentioned my concerns over that wire? Less than two months after I got them the sound would only work when the wire was tilted to a certain side. I figured it was an inconvenience at most and I used one of those twist ties to hold the wire down to that side. The wire constantly twists itself though (maybe it is the weird cloth wrappings on it?) and after a week or so would be in bundles of twistings on itself. The cord no longer works in the left ear at all as of today, no matter which way I tilt it. So the headset was sort of messed up about a month after my purchase and now does not work at all on one side just four months after I bought the set. I am not very upset since they were pretty cheap but I have to say, I did expect to get more than four months out of them.

I would rate these 2 stars if they weren't so cheap. The price alone earns it that third star but BUYER BEWARE! these are not made to last.",So close to the best budget set in the game.,1420502400,19,,

3.0,True,"12 12, 2008",ANVMG7KEOBH9P,B0017ZK7PA,Renigami,"I stumbled upon this title, I have read the reviews, I seen the game on Youtube being demonstrated. So finally I decided to cast away any inhibitions and purchased the game for $30 (minus a few cents) from Amazon of which came earlier than expected! Thumbs up for Amazon for the delivery!

Where to start... This game is full of saccharin anime-esq cuteness that fits the We Cheer atmosphere. Upon loading, I selected an empty data slot, chosen my name and cheergirl, to be greeted by very basic tutorials. Of which are quite helpful in figuring out how the motions work and how to play the game. I felt that the very first timing demonstration is useless. All others are helpful though. The motions work in detecting the EXACT or close to EXACT accelerations of the Wiimote. Sure you can possibly fudge the momentum of the wiimotes without doing the intended game motions but I found it to be very difficult to get right. I think this is also the reason why it is insistant on the basic position. Even then, during the tutorial, the down motions aren't exactly correct for me. Yes I did follow the star marker timings (as I said, it is the EXACT acceleration at the EXACT moment or close to).

Passing the initial tutorial with the new data slot (ala Elite Beat Agents), I am greeted by the game options, Championship plays through various game stages with the respective songs with unlockable stages, Cheer Off allowing multiplayer bouts, Workout for doing wiimote motions for a certain time period to workout, Dressing room to dress up your chosen cheerleader, Squad Makeover to select and customize the appearances of your cheermates, Practice - taking you back to what you experienced upon starting a new data file, and Game options.

Champtionship initially has four venues to play in and a handful of songs to work with. The game does detect either one or two remotes in use and will adjust the game accordingly to suit the remotes in play. So Wii owners who declined on Wii Play upon purchase of their console won't feel left out (although it is much more fun and balanced with two). Strangely enough, my first successful song was one of the four star lebeled difficulty ones of ""Push it"". The gameplay here is not as simple as the tutorial as I felt the game quickly puts you into the cheerleading seat of doing the motions. Expect to see that failure screen many many times. And the on-screen trace lines for the most part are self explanitory of what your arms are supposed to do. With some exceptions. The very short trace lines involving little motions are hard to pick up on as I can't get it to register my accelerations most to all of the time. Generally, flowing movements does work most of the time and the game doesn't like stiffness. I felt the game plays successfully if one is relaxed during this, and somewhat following the cheerleader AND the trace lines.

I do appreciate the bonus chance lines, successfully nabbing one allows for extra mistakes for the rest of the song. However I felt there should be more chances and songs being longer but that is just me. The song is successfully done when your megaphone meter on screen is completely full. It isn't like DDR where you keep the energy meter from being empty, it is the exact opposite. Fortunately, mistakes don't lower your megaphone meter but you will be waving your arms to try as many successful motions for the fill up.

Difficulty wise, obviously everything is on easy. Once you have completed a song for the first time, the respective unlocks for new cheerleaders come about and from then on, the little short scenes always have some dude wanting you to cheer him on for his respective event, same lines and everything. This IMO breaks up the energetic flow of the game along with the not so bad loading screen. It also unlocks the song's respective hard mode of which the motions get a bit more complicated. From what I experienced, your left and right arms will behave differently as some parts of the hard songs require split coordination.

Circular motions register very well if your timing is with the star marker. Especially big sweeping ones.

There are scenes between you going into a song and completing one but in my opinion either needs to go away completely after the first run-in by the player and needs to be part of the loading screen process (as I noticed how good loading screens are dealt with) or the story mode needs not to be shallow as it is.

As for the songs themselves, very upbeat and for the most part follow your motions. As I have said before, they could be a bit longer remixes with more chances for bonuses but as it is it is still good.

The Cheer Off gameplay has each player with a single Wiimote for the motions, or two players with two wiimotes. It plays the same as the Championship venue but instead of the visuals of alot of cheerleaders, you have four cheerleaders with respect to each player (regardless how many players they are).

Workout mode is fairly simple. The motions appears to remain the same no matter how much you play it and the mini scenes amount to a fat friend asking for your help for workout and as the mode progresses, if you successfully complete more motions, he gets thin. Score is replaced by a calorie counter, not to be taken seriously. The workout mode isn't as intense as I like it to be, basically equating to a normal song playthrough but longer and repetitive over time with the same motions done. *EDIT* Now that I played through Workout a bit more, you really can't select your own songs like DDR Hottest Party 2. So for those looking to string several of the tracks together to continuously work through it, I am afraid you have to put up with Championship mode and the pauses between songs.

Dressing room allows you to customize your cheearleader (and your whole team's outfit as a result). From tops to bottoms to socks and shoes, even the name and logo on the outfit. You gain new items from completed songs in Championship mode and Workout mode (if the guy likes what you done for him). Outfits can range from Rated G exposure to Rated PG-ish exposure for those that are worried about that...

Squad Makeover selects four other team members of yours that are upfront on the stage and at the ending score screen. New characters are unlocked with the completion of the first song of each different stage.

There isn't much to options. You can change the trace lines to the standard big lines, small thin lines, or for the intrepid, no lines to cue you for motions - just relying on instantly seeing the star marker and following it or watching the cheerleader and mimicking the motions. Hell I have a hard time just having the game accept some of my motions let alone even making a good effort waving blind :P. Timing options does exist too to offset the display and your motions but it has not been of much obvious noticability other than the difference between 1 and 8-9 for me. The higher the level, the bit more slack the game allows you for the marker timing as far as I seen.

Visually, it isn't much too look at and as I have said everything is pretty much sugary cute. But that is not why one would buy this game. The game is one that is alright for the first get go of motion games but I would have liked it if Bandai-Namco would release another We Cheer taking advantage of the Motion Plus. For the most part the game controls OK but it does take that practice and learning curve to find out what you need to make your arms accelerate and flow to get the ""cool"" points for a successful song. It isn't perfect, some of the onscreen motions don't exactly match up to what I am doing, example being downward motions from the middle of the screen to the bottom, but hell the game is not quite broken either - well except the time the game crashed (yes this is the second Wii game I ever had to CRASH on me, while switching between Dressing Room and the Main Menu - first being Strong Bad Episode 1).

Cliffs:

This game is pretty good, not perfect, but not bad either.
The dialog scenes interrupt the energy of the game. But this is a minor nitpick. Same with the loading screen between each song and stage, isn't bad but could be handled better.
I can't for the love of me do correct downward type motions.
I don't mind the anime-chibi characters, they have grown on me. I like Ai the best.
Workout mode is hardly a workout mode. DDR for me was more intense.
I need to experiment with weights on my arms, this maybe a great arm workout.
Visual customization galore! I am surprised by the options for such a game.
Game Options settings aren't much to look at.
Kids can get the hang of it if they follow the markers to the T and flow their arms but it maybe a bit difficult for such age groups. Adults can have fun with this title too.
Would like to see a second one with Motion Plus involved.

Side Note:
How the heck the player managed 190 combos? I keep messing up every 5 or so combos due to ill-motion-registering acts. Maybe I just need more practice...

Although they stopped making video game systems, they really kept gamers going for video games for other consoles like Playstation 2, and the Xbox. Now, the latest title finally decides which of the most beloved mascots is better, the beloved Mario or the fast and furious Sonic. This is the title for the Wii that could make gamers decide, young and old.

Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the Nintendo Wii, finally puts 2 of the popular video game mascots head to head in a battle that takes place in the upcoming 2008 Summer Olympics. This game, you can play not just as Sonic or Mario, but characters like Luigi, Tails who is Sonic's sidekick, Bowser, Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach, Yoshi and many others in a battle for the quest for Olympic Gold. The game features twists on classic races like Track & Field, swimming, fencing, table tennis and the hammerthrow. The graphics look very well while the action doesn't really deliver for solo players, but multiplayer action fairs a little better. You can also use their special battle features like power ups and special tactics like Bowser's fire breath, and Sonic's speed to help you through the game as well, and the Wi-Fi gameplay adds a little bit more. Although the gameplay isn't as bad, it just doesn't click to die hard Wii fans who want more outrageous gameplay they would get from Mario Party 8 or mario Strikers Charged brought excitement.

All in all, many more gamers are much more anxious for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii. Mario & Sonic At The Summer Olympics isn't a bad game, but just misses the mark in fun and excitement for die hard fans of both franchises. I really recommend you get this as a rental, and see if you like it as a addition to your Wii library.

the characters are interesting but the story seemed rushed but at the same time, LONG and GRUELING. they focus on things that don't really need to be focused on. and the whole thing felt like it was a prototype for the rest of the games that came after it. i played Tales of Symphonia before i played this so i don't know which came out first. but i can tell you i like the feel of ToS better than ToL.

it's 2D fighting in the battle field. and monsters attack you RANDOMLY they don't run the screen like in other Tales of Games i've played. you could literally run Three Steps and be attacked my a monster. the only time the monsters are visible are in actual dungeons.

oh, and the VOICE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE!!!! and the timing was baaaaddddddddddd....... though there are funny seens they seem to be muffled by the fact that the only well voiced characters in the ENTIRE game are Grune and the Raynard dude...(can't remember his first name norma calls him 'teach'...) because the processing time in the game or the way it was made or voiced it, the jokes seem... ill timed... you felt kind of slow getting them or they didn't translate well from japanese or they were marred by the fact that the only voice that norma has is that same high voice slightly devoid of emotion other than 'bubbly...' ever her sad seems bubbly.

the sound effects (on normal settings) and any voices in the game (save Grune and Raynard) were unnecessarily loud.

the game is good it's fun when it's not mind numbingly annoying and throw-the-controller-at-the-screen frustrating.  (one puzzle in particular where you have to sneak into a military base at night... >_> timing is key i hated it i quit playing it for a month.)

the game was fun and like all tales of games has some sort of underlying after-school-special message (Tales of Symphonia = Discrimination is wrong... there were several other messages too but this one was the main one that kept slapping you in the face...) to tell you the truth... the only thing i got from ToL was Polluting the world's Freshwater Sources is bad... >_> don't build ships the size of islands and have it run off of the life force of mermaids with feet. and the hot airhead chick is really a goddess... and not to take in wild animals as pets they can turn on you.

all and all id have to give this a tree only because there was alot of this game that got on my nerves. the battle lay out the slow but rushed story line where they gave you too much information on something not relevant but not enough on something you needed. (okay, go fight this guy... why? because he's evil... this rock is an ancient rock passed down from the Goddesses to the humans millions of years ago if you set it on fire... that sort of thing.) the voice acting was slow and bad and i'm sure you'll spend more time pressing x to get through the cut scenes than actually watching them (god knows i wanted to).  but the voice acting would have been on the back burner for me if it was just the minor skits but it's the major skits and cut seens that take up a LARGE ten percent of the game. the other 89percent is spent making different types of bread to carry around which you can only carry fifteen in total. not fifteen different kinds, just fifteen. five Bagles with lox, five pizzas three bread loaves a pie and a sandwich (really?) yes really. i'm half dead i have no apple gels left the onlything that will keep me from dying is a loaf of bread... >_> sure why not.

3.0,False,"08 29, 2004",A3QZTVW9TT5QKU,B0000695GX,James Ha,"After a very long time with no official site updates or new changes to the game, it was exciting to hear that RCT developers were coming up with a new sequel to the Original Rollercoaster Tycoon.

 The new sequel is like the original RCT1 with all it's expansion packs combined with technical changes. The sequel has scarcely changed and this has more disadvantages than advantages. Before explaining about the ""down sides' let's talk about what this game is like. Rollercoaster Tycoon series are about designing your own park, managing it, analysing it, and building the rides and attractions, and creating the ultimate park. Also to that, the developers did lot of field research and added realism to the game as well as adding great physics engine to ride construction, and almost every material in the game really exists. And one of the most remarkable source in the game is the ride construction engine and system. It has the most incredibly simple and extremely free system in construction of rides and gives great depth of creativity, so you can either build a great rollercoaster or a terrible one -All the rides have a excitement, intensity, and nausea value due to it's design- rollercoasters and other track rides can be built by placing track segments.

 The park design and management in the game is challenging enough to keep the fun in the game: one ride or one food stall misplaced may cause great loss in profit and park value; price every rides every stalls by analysing the circumstances; angry and dissatisfied guests, or no guests in the park even if you have the perfect rides or value are all the things you'll have to handle in this game. And these things can make you pause the game to analyze the park just to place a burger stall or dealing with the financial board to check your park growth or income from all of the park things.

 Although the RCT1 and RCT2 has all these great sources in the game, there are few things that keeps the RCT2 down. First of all, nothing really changed. You select a park and achieve the objective given to you with each scenario and it's almost the same with RCT1, like increasing guests and park value and all those same things. And this game constantly and loads anytime if it has the chance. Which is frustrating because it even loads when exiting to the main menu. To make matters worse, all the scenarios in the game are all unlocked from the start. RCT1 added good old arcade game feature to increase the fun of the game and make the scenarios unlocked if you finish other available parks, so RCT2 loses one of RCT1's advantages. Some people might look forward to the park creator tool, but it's too time consuming and not as easy as it looks. They could have added more improvements in the game like multiplayer mode by the internet for players to challenge their tycoon skills.

 Anyway RCT2 era it almost over and the new sequel Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is being developed with high-quality 3D graphics and diversity in guests with more personality to them. But if it isn't accompanied by a major positive change in the game, it's not going to be a greater game than its earlier versions.

 To sum up, Rollercoaster Tycoon series is a great series but the first sequel of the  original Rollercoaster Tycoon needs to be looked carefully before you decide to get it.","Great series, disappointing sequel",1093737600,,,

The Bad: Terrible voice acting, sad story, sad graphics, sub-par sounds, shallow combat system, hidden content is a pain to find

Side game have been very poor when it comes to Mortal Kombat. Shaolin Monks is probably the first good one, but still isn't perfect and has many flaws. You play as either Kung-Lao or Liu-Kang and the game is set in the Mortal Kombat II universe. The two champions run around different worlds such as the Living Forest, The Wastelands, The Wu-Shi Academy, and even the Soul Tombs. They are trying to stop Shao-Kahn, but the story is pretty stretched out and not very good even for MK fans. You come across fan favorites such as Baraka, Mileena, Kitana, and even Scorpion.

The game is an action-adventure and has a pretty solid fighting system. There are light attacks, heavy attacks, power attacks, and special attacks. Each character has their signature power attacks such as Kang's flying side kick, bicycle kick, and fireballs. Lao has his hat toss and many others. The combat system is responsive and quick and is pretty fun to use. You can accomplish some big combos in the or on the ground. There is the option to unlock new moves via points that you get from killing enemies, and yes don't worry, fatalities are present. These are performed by performing combos and building your fatality meter. One full orb lets you do a fatality, two lets you perform a mutality, and three lets you perform a brutality. Fatalities can be unlocked by finding hidden red coins (trust me they are a pain to find without the strategy guide). New fatalities are obtained by finding those red coins and unlocking ""Fatality Images"" which are viewed in the concept art area. This can be a bit of a pain and loading and saving is slow and tedious.

The game has combat puzzles that involve using your abilities. This involves knocking enemies is viscous death traps, or Test Your Might strength puzzles (MK fans will love this). Each level has different death traps such as in The Living Forest you must feed the trees bodies before passing, and in The Soul Tombs, knocking enemies into spiked ceilings, or iron maidens. The game is brutal like MK is known for and that will satisfy fans. Even the fatalities are awesome, but unlocking the best takes a lot of hunting for those red coins.

Getting through the game has kind of a Metroid feel since you must find certain abilities to reach different parts of the game like double jump, pole swinging, wall run, and fists of ruin. This, unfortunately, makes back tracking tiresome. What makes that worse is some coins aren't reachable until you get said ability and this could be really far into the game and you might forget to go back. This is just one of many flaws the game has. The combat system may be solid, but it's a bit shallow and could have used some more depth. Most of the flaws revolve around the graphics. They aren't that great. Even when the game came about in 2005 they weren't showing the PS2's true potential and this is sad. The game is full of low res textures and models, and it looks worse than the franchises' staple fighting games. There are collision detection issues, and complete hang ups that require system restarts. Save points are scarce, and you don't even have to kill enemies to progress. What's up with that? There are only a few times where you must kill enemies to progress, but most of the time you can just pass them, and what I truly hate is the fact that they can respawn.

The sounds in the game are ok but they could have been better. All the MKII sounds are used, so nostalgia sets in, but I would have liked some richer sounds. The voice acting is also terrible, but MK is known for that. The game doesn't look high budget even though Midway (RIP) gives the MK team endless amounts of money to make these. This disappointed me more than anything along with the super short length. 4-6 is the completion time, and some hardcore players could finish this in one or two sittings. What makes up for some of the short comings is the Ko-op mode, however, but this also makes those damn red coins more of a pain to obtain since some can only be obtained via Ko-op.

The game has fun boss fights, lots of secrets, tons of MKII references, and using that universe will make fans happy. If you can see past the short comings underneath is a solid MK side game that I hope sees a sequel with a bigger budget. You can find this game for less than $10 in most places so it's bargain bin price point is just more of a reason for people to play this game.",A great fight system is plagued with a stupid story and ugly visuals,1332892800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,False,"04 3, 2012",ARBA3PVDL118W,B00006IJMS,teejay,"This is a very late review - 2012. With interest peaking with regards to the new Mechwarrior Online, I figured I'd revisit the old Mechwarrior games.

By far this game is a mixed bag. When Mechwarrior 2 mercenaries first game out in 1996, that game was considered a real improvement over the previous iteration, the resource management meta-game was new to the series, and the game engine itself was revamped (and MUCH more challenging for systems of the time to run). Believe it or not, that game was a ""Crysis"" of its day.

The same cannot be said for Mechwarrior 4:Mercenaries.  Rather than push the limits of the engine, the opposite tack was taken. Yes there is a mercenaries meta-game attached and it is fun, but the underlying mech combat engine has not been improved at all (in fact the following criticisms can be applied to all the mechwarrior 4 games). In fact, it's arguably uglier than ever.  The silly primary colors of the mechs does not fit the previous art style of the franchise well at all and was a major disappointment. The gameplay is faster and more arcadey, for better or worse, less 'sim-like'.

Changes were made to the mech customization rules in the mechwarrior 4 line which have been controversial, throwing out criticals that can be filled with any equipment to that of 'hard-points', where only weapons of a certain type can be put in specific hard-points. This particular change I can appreciate, and it does add tactical variety beyond raw mech tonnage. In Mechwarrior 4, two different model mechs, while having the same weight class, can have totally different hard-point loadouts which will make them very different mechs. Additionally, Something like a Mad Cat, which has two big LRM pods on its shoulders, will actually HAVE LRMs int those crit points, or nothing at all. No stealth lasers in your LRM pods.

Unfortunately the praise ends there. The game looks cartoony and not in a good way: the lack of shading and light effects present even in MW3, and generally low-level textures make the game look raw and ugly, and the game engine definitely doesn't challenge even the hardware of its day, although the framerate is always stellar. Worse, whatever Microsoft did programming the engine makes it VERY hard to get working on modern machines, or even contemporary machines with modern software. The game does not run at all in a 64 bit environment, and even on a circa 2005 era Windows XP machine, I have to disable joystick support altogether to keep the game from crashing to desktop, and before you ask, yes I have all my drivers up to date. If anything, that is the problem - I suspect something in the MW4 game engine does not play nice with the current flavors of DirectInput. Fortunately one can work around this limitation by using keyboard mapping software but not having true analog axis control is kind of a letdown.

Despite all these criticisms Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries is not a bad game, it's just potentially part of the reason there was no Mechwarrior 5 (MW:O notwithstanding). If you're new to the Mechwarrior series, I suggest picking up Mechwarrior 3 instead. That is the high point of the series in my opinion, with the best looking graphics (despite being a few years older), a better, more sim-like 'feel', and a mechlab that is based on the original Battletech rule set.  That game has its own set of flaws (notably the horrendous friendly AI), but overall was a more fun game IMO.

MW4:Mercs is a game for completionists only. 3 stars (out of 5).

3.0,False,"07 15, 2005",A1LVMQ52YODRMO,B00097CYZS,sporkdude,"This game has an interesting concept.  You're an alien, and you have to take over the country.  You're named Crypto, and you accomplish this task through over twenty levels, spanning six areas.  Each mission, with the exception of the last, is very short (i.e. less than 20 minutes).  They are mostly in the form of a third person shooter, but sometimes require you take control of a flying saucer.

The gameplay mechanics are pretty simple.  For the third person aspect, you have 4 total weapons, and a few telepathic powers (brainscan, lift objects, copy the form of a human).  Most missions require you to get to some certain place.  Often times you need to copy the form of a person and walk to the place.  It's a little annoying, because you can't use weapons or pick up objects in a human form, and certain federal agents keep disrupting your human form (which, in latter missions, means you start the mission over).  Afterwards, you just have to shoot people, protect, or destroy objects.  Nothing radical or special here.  The controls are really easy to master though.

For the saucer parts, you control a saucer that apparently can't go up or down.  You use a few weapons to destroy certain things, and you can collect items to give you more ammo or heal your ship.  Pretty simple, though standard fair.

This game, though, is very playable.  The graphics are pretty good.  The levels, though really small, offer some freedom of movement (everyone says GTA, but it's definitely not as large or as open).  Except for the last level, you don't repeat or get stuck in one place for too long.  It's a bit on the easy side in the beginning, and a bit annoying at the end, but the difficulty balance is pretty good.  Also, the cutscenes and humor are both funny and relevant to today's politics.  That's an added bonus.

However, there are numerious problems with this game.  Many people somehow love this game, but unfortunately, I don't see it.  First off, there are no mission saves or checkpoints.  This is beyond lame.  I don't like repeating stuff I already did.  Even though missions are short, I still don't want to repeat 15 minutes of gameplay if I die in the end.  At the end of the game, getting to the boss requires 20 minutes of gameplay.  After dying a few times, I said forget this and used a cheat to finish the last 5 minutes.  Secondly, this game doesn't offer much in terms of gameplay.  Not much strategy or innovation involved.  The shoot 'em up is really standard, and the stealth movement is annoying because it's just boring (take the shape of a human, scan a person, avoid federal agent, rinse, repeat).  Finally, there is no fluidity or continuity.  There are constant breaks in the action, as missions are small and repetitive, so that it is a major chore to sit and play this game for more than an hour straight.

All in all, it's not a bad game, but it really isn't that good of a game either.

Good graphics

Good cut-scenes

Not that this is a bad game, but it's not that good either. Graphic-wise it's one of the best with some nice innovations included, such as the ability to glide (although it's not really used enough), the ability to ride under water (that's kind of cool), the offering of more alternate pathways in the vertical as well as the horizontal, and the offering of some new and interesting weapons, such as the ability to shoot fireballs and become a bullet bill temporarily.

However, this game does get a bit boring quickly due to the monotonousness of the level designs. The levels are all pretty similar with little variation like in the Game Cube version, where the levels are more interesting and have a wide array of opponents like the giant cactuses. The music is mostly unremarkable and most of it sounds like it was written by third-rate composers (though a lot of video games these days are having this problem). Perhaps only the music in the Calamari Desert caught my attention. Also, what motivation does anyone have to unlock characters, if most of the characters in the game are dorks? Gone are the cool characters like Waluigi. And even Wario decided to take a hike from most of this race. (Though he appears as an unlockable later when most of the game is nearly spent.) Instead all we get are bunch of stupid characters that all look like bugs or insects! (I wonder who thought of those!)

But the most important thing Nintendo has to realize, if it decides to release another Mario Kart game is that all the innovations in the world aren't gonna matter too much if the heart is just not in it. The public will catch on and recognize most of those innovations as being mostly gimmicks! For example, am I the only one who notices that no matter how much time passes and how many years go by and how many innovations are made, these Mario Kart games always seem to retain certain constants!

For example, shouldn't Nintendo by now be giving us something a little more interesting than mirror mode as a reward for all the hard work we do in completing these courses? Maybe they should enable us to unlock some strange levels that defy laws of gravity and maybe move vertically instead of horizontally. Or they could offer us levels that rely more on gliding rather than staying grounded most of the time. They might even combine battling with the races a bit!

While mirror mode may have seemed cute 15 or so years ago, it's a bit tiresome now. They could still include mirror mode; but they should also give something extra as stated above.

Another constant that I'm pretty sick and tired of (and am surprised that no one else is) is the fact that the number of competitors always has an 8-count. Technologically, I would think that by now, Nintendo should be capable of offering us MORE than just seven other racers to compete with! I mean, while winning in the top 3 out of 8 racers may be good, winning the top 3 out of 12 or even 16 is divine! And perhaps if Nintendo started thinking about these things, a lot of other things would follow, they wouldn't look as corny, and we'd appreciate their innovations more!

3.0,False,"12 24, 2011",A3NMVT4I7RRD75,B001CWXAP2,T. J. Young,"Let's set the stage here for the review. I want to say that I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan. Played almost EVERY game that's ever been made through LucasArts, read all of the books (just about), and watched all the films. I have a decent PC:

Azza Solano 1000 Case
Asus M4A87TD Evo motherboard
AMD 1075T (3.0ghz - Six Core) processor
MSI Twin Frozr II OC 6950 2GB graphics card
12GB G.skill Ripjaw X Series 1600mhz (7-8-7-24 timings) RAM
BFG 1000 Watt Power Supply (Bronze)

Needless to say I was expecting a lot in this game. This was the game that ended Star Wars Galaxies (which love it or hate it, it was the single best MMO of its time back before the CU). This is the only Star Wars MMO operating today, and made MANY claims throughout development. Not to mention had a financial backing to rival if not surpass most Hollywood blockbuster films.

Now, I beta tested the game from Closed Beta on to release. I made the choice to not purchase the game because of a number of issues to be explained later. Luckily for me, a friend gave me a copy for free, so I've now subscribed to it. There are some elements to the game that are enjoyable, and some down right frustrating. As always, buyer beware. That is where I come in.

To start with some of the positives... the game is a Star Wars game. Right off the bat it should appeal to a LOT of people. It also is set many thousands of years in the past (meaning before the original trilogy of films). Which now has Jedi and Sith on the brink of open war. This will also appeal to those who are obsessed with Jedi. I for one, HATE them. I hate what LucasArts/Books has done with Jedi to make them be the ""superheroes"" of the franchise. They can perform feats, and do things that are almost impossible to counter. They basically become a ""Superman"" of Star Wars and we all know that in the end, one might die, but the good guys will always win. It's boring. It's why I root for the Imperials through most of the books and films... they always seem to need the help.

But any way, rant aside. The games setting is fairly new in that it's thousands of years in the past. There are some locations you'll recognize like Tatooine, Hutta, Coruscant, etc. You'll be given the opportunity to play your part in a time that is relatively untouched by the expanded universe of games and books.

Now, when you begin you start off you pick either the Sith or Republic side. From there each side has four classes to choose from (ie. Inquisitor, Smuggler, COmmando, Bounty Hunter). Each class has two sub ""classes"" or specialties that you'll be able to pick around level 10. The simple approach and rounded classes might appeal to some... it's easy to have a defined character that has a set purpose or angle. I'll go into this more later.

As you explore you'll come into contact with new races of people not mentioned or rarely touched on during the Star Wars saga. Each interaction is completely scripted with full speech recorded in a studio. You'll be given options to respond in your characters set speech throughout the interactions as well, and choose the fate of the conversation at times.

You'll have the opportunity to group with other players, and quest... while exploring certain areas of worlds. Very cool for those that want to see different places and have fun with their friends.

But, there are some flaws to this game. I found more problems than I did find enjoyment. Granted and maybe unfairly I came into this game during the beta with the understanding that this game will be absolute garbage. I did this because I knew they (Bioware) were making an MMO based on a single player game... and have never tried this before. The Knights series was great for what it was, but I didn't think it would do justice to the galaxy as an MMO. I think I was right.

Right off the bat the thing that bothered me was that this isn't a traditional MMO. This to me, is a single player game with a multiplayer mod attached that allows you to join others in certain circumstances or when you can't do it yourself. I didn't feel like I was really a part of the story, or affecting any outcomes. I'd do something that should kill an NPC but then that NPC is still standing there a week later. My choices felt like they had no affect on anything. I played two characters, one killed a guy, the other didn't. I felt no different either way.

I found that although cool as it was... the speech and conversations got tedious, annoying, and I ended up mashing my spacebar most of the time. Speech is great, story background is fantastic. But none of it made any real difference. If I listened to it and then made a decision, I didn't really do any better than skipping it, not hearing a word, and making a choice. None of the outcomes really made me stop and think, short of just one (involving getting a man killed or killing a pack of Sith... either of which was not much of a win for me as a hunter).

Each major decision in the game is controlled by ""Light Points"" and ""Darkside Points"". It annoyed me that certain choices were really geared one way, turned out to be the opposite. I would kill someone and somehow get Light points. Really?

The points themselves really haven't done anything to my character yet to affect it. So not sure why they're even a factor.

I found starting in Hutta (as a Bounty Hunter)... the worlds are VERY bland. The textures are blurry, and boring. The shadows are pixelated messes. I had EVERY graphics setting turned up and set my gpu to enforce the in-game settings. The world still looked like a mess. I thought it would get better in the second world Kaas but it didn't. Instead of a yellow mess, I now have a purple mess which sometimes rains. My hopes during the beta was that this would all be different for release... that they had some HD textures ready to go. That didn't happen.

The worlds themselves are arenas. Those of us who played Galaxies will remember Dantooine or other planets where if you ran left of the spaceport far enough, you ended up coming back from the right of the spaceport (as if the world was a sphere). Here, you hit a wall (constructed with terrain) like most non-open world MMO's. Most of the areas you can't even get to because of drops offs, mountains, etc. I really wanted to EXPLORE the worlds and see different species of creatures (and maybe kill them... hehe). But instead I'm aggro'd by everything on my way from point A to B and the animals are cookie cutters of the last with different character models.

Going back real quick but on the topic of character models... I found the character creation to be horrendous. You have a set of races for each class, and then a set number of options for 8 or so sliding options. I created 5 or 6 characters now and even if I went absurd with them, I found people in game that almost looked exactly alike. There were no real options like APB, or even the original SWG. I want to be unique and the four body types, 12 faces, etc... just make me look like everyone else. Not fun for me.

Once in game, the armor for Bounty Hunters looks EXACTLY the same. I went through three sets and short of lights being moved around and a color change, they all look like Boba Fetts. Anyone remember Leia rescuing Han? That armor was in SWG and VASTLY different from everything else. SWG had a ton of armor types and you really looked different (with the ability to mix and match). TOR? Not so much.

I know, I know... this isn't Galaxies. I know exactly what this is, and it's irritating to me. It lacks the vision and scope that I thought it was going to have through the development. I've been following this game since the very first day their website was created many years ago. I was hyped.

Any way... Bioware... what can be said about them? They're a fantastic development company. They put out a lot of great products. Unfortunately this one doesn't look hot. The engine looks aged, the graphics boring, the animations cookie cutter... the bugs are rampant through the game which can be dismissed as a release game that needs patches. But stuff like your companion flying through the air, or speeder bikes going underground to drop you off... that's just poor quality. Stuff like, two robot NPC's spawning inside of each other and walking a designated path... yeah it's funny but poor.

One of the more frustrating things about this game is the necessity of the devs to make everything re-populate instantly. I get that they don't want people waiting... but filler NPC's in a hallway for example that are not mission objectives don't need to respawn 2 minutes after death. You basically fight through a mob... complete an objective or talk to an NPC, turn around and find everything repopulated. What a pain.

The maps are linear and you are forced into areas that no one in their right mind would want to go. I'm a Bounty Hunter... a trained assassin... I'm not going to walk over a log over a ravine between two sets of 4 mobs. I'll find another way to approach the situation... maybe use that jetpack on my back!

The social aspects of this game leave so much to be desired it's unbelievable. I was a HUGE role player in SWG. We used to have groups of Stormtroopers (players) patrolling towns and other people acting out rebels doing an ambush, or smugglers delivering illegal goods. It was fun! Here, I go to a cantina and find 2 people. Most I imagine are leveling... but on an RP designated server... you'd expect areas where people can really interact. You'd expect the emoticons or /emotes to be plentiful to help you guide your characters actions. In TOR, they almost don't exist.

Quests are ""go deliver this"", ""go kill these""... the standard MMO quests. A problem SWG my commonly used example had as well. There's little variety though where I've seen other MMO's almost NEVER repeat a similar quest. I know once I max a character I'll almost have no reason to try again (more so with the same class).

The class system as I mentioned before is cookie cutter. What I love is the ability to have a custom style. I want some of this, and some of that. I want my character to be MY character. Not the same as the next guy. But in running through a mission with two other hunters... we all had the SAME gear, same weapons, and fired off the same attacks. Its lame.

Now, there are ""flashpoints"" (grouped epic missions) and I did like the roll system that allows each person to submit their choice in a dialogue answer which if you won it displayed. But frankly, it made little difference other than affect your Light/Dark points from time to time. The mission still completes the same way for the most part anyway.

Don't even get me started on the space combat. Rails... really? Reminds me of the Star Wars arcade game with the three separate missions... even then I felt like I had more maneuverability. It's like the old Starfox games... fly straight, and turn your guns left and right. Even early 90's games had free flight in their games like TIE Fighter... X-Wing... etc. Maybe they weren't planning on putting it in the game for launch... but don't half ass it. Do or don't, there is no try right?

Customer support is a mess for this game. I haven't been able to post on the forums at ALL with my newer account registered to my subscription. My old account I created when the website opened works fine but the new one from July won't allow me to post. It tells me that I don't have the permissions. So, I submit a ticket and it's now been a week with no resolution. I figured I could post bug reports or other issues but not possible. A buddy of mine forgot his security phrase, so he submitted a ticket (with no response) and then decided to call them. He spent a half hour on the phone before it disconnected and then another hour or two on a return call to get a simple process reset. Their wait times are crazy!

Lastly, be careful what server you join. Some of them have queues and the initial people are the ones hurting for it because they were assigned a server at launch. Guilds as a whole joined one server together regardless of server population (though the intent was to avoid overpopulation). Some people are now waiting hours with hundreds of people in the queue during peak times. I myself have been lucky to only have to wait 30 minutes so far.

All in all... I'm not impressed per se. I'm still playing it... and it's keeping me distracted. I have subbed for three months and will decide after that if I continue. Since I paid nothing for the game, I might as well give them enough of a sub to compensate. Which by the way, this game nor any PC game should be $60. But after this subscription... we'll see what I do from there.

I'm hoping they'll be adding more content, improve on the bugs, and expand the worlds. I want to see some QUALITY graphics that stun me... not remind me of World of Warcraft, or early 2000's era. For their sake, they might have the highest subscription rate now... but they'll have the fastest loss of any game too if they don't step up their game. For anyone thinking about buying it... beware of the issues but I won't stop you from getting it. I won't tell you not either.

I miss a lot of the old simplistic ones you could pick up and basically just play and have a good time.  Plot?  Who needs a plot?  You're an Army dude and there are zombies.  You can find a Russian and a German officer and they'll join up with you to save their own skin too.  It's really nice once you have them, since they add firepower and give you an extra ""life"" since if you die you can take over one of them; you can also switch between them anytime you have them along.

So what were the problems?  Well, first off the game has no real tutorial.  It's an annoying trend and IMHO that's just a lazy developer.  You're creating a unique world of your own imagination.  You need to provide a basic framework to the people who are visiting or they'll end up getting frustrated more than is necessary.  The game needlessly wastes your time trying to figure out what makes you survive by trial and error.  There is also the frame rate.  I have a core i7 running 3+GH and I got massive slowdown at full screen from time to time.  The engine that runs it needs a significant amount of polish.  This can also leave you frustrated.  Still, considering the price, it's not a deal breaker.

The family-friendly gameplay is fun and challenging and the ability to play with others is it's biggest draw for me. The fun cooperative play is above par. The creative levels and new characters keep this game feeling fresh instead of just a new collection of levels. And always, the gameplay is fun and stress-free and inspiring as you realize that regular people are out there creating levels of their own.

On one hand, here you have a game that, by design, should really be an experience that continues long after beating it because of all the user-generated content out there.

1. Long and frequent loading times.
2. Unskippable sections with lots of talking.
3. Unskippable cut scenes
4. Hub world does nothing for the game and serves as a vehicle for more loading times

This should be a game that you can casually pop in and play a few levels. Sadly, the cutscene and painfully long loading times make each session of play a time commitment. Before every attempt at each level, you will need to sit through a loading screen usually followed by some story-driven chitchat from one of the game's characters. If replaying a level due to failure or in effort to find more collectibles, this becomes mentally taxing as you wait.

I play games like this because the Little Big Planet games have always had a solid cooperative experience. Sadly, with this entry, there is nothing fun about two people sitting there staring at loading screens.

However, I've never owned a ski game for any console or my computer, and having skied 30 years and a expert skier, I thought I'd try it because of the subject matter and something fun for the kids. Also, Wii has forced me to look around a lot, because there aren't a lot of games for Wii and the ones that are available aren't very good.

I should also note, that NAMCO does a good job with Wii games (for the most part). We have their Outdoor Adventure game and the whole family loves it. I highly recommend that game too.

At the outset; ""We Ski"" is stylish, colorful and cute. The menus are easy to navigate and inviting. I opened it up, turned it on and started to ski immediately. There was little to no learning curve. Although my wife wanted to take the lessons and learn more details that the game had to offer. I appreciate this, because most games have a steep learning curve and the frustration usually has me and other non-gamers give up early. But this isn't the case with ""We Ski"".

Some reviewers have complained about the controls not feeling like real skiing and other technical issues of this sort. Of course the game isn't EXACTLY like real skiing. I think those folks are being a little too critical of a COMPUTER GAME that is supposed to be for kids and family. Not a government simulator made for US Army ski units. Also keep in mind, this cute game is no World of Warcraft, Gears of War 2 or any other 5 star game. It's a simple little game tailored for kids and family interaction.

What is good about Wii Ski is;
-  Fun right out of the box with a gentle learning curve.
- Great background and cute character graphics.
- Fairly real looking snow and weather conditions.
- Interesting unlocking of gear and clothing.
- Tasks, quests and things to do that will extend game play (time).
-  Innovative computer ski lift, ski controls, etc etc.

What is lacking or missing is:
- More ski resorts, ski-runs or scenery.
- More quests and various levels (as in World of Warcraft).
- Online play with relatives or friends (multiplayer game-play online).
- More varied weather.

I have not played multiplayer much, but it appears to add something to the game and I look forward to trying it on family game night.

To sum up, if you keep all that into perspective, you'll like ""We Ski"".

3.0,True,"09 28, 2016",ACIZ77IGIX2JL,B00ENQXEX2,Era,"While many things are taken that were standard with Sims 3, Sims 4 is interesting in it's own right.

Pros-
- More body customization. One can pinch and poke and pull their way to a dream body.
- Walking and talking animation personalization.
- Ability to dress a man in women's clothing and vice versa.
- A character doesn't necessarily need to be male or female. They can be completely sexually ambiguous if you want.
- There are entire pre-made rooms that one can use. Just pick a color and plop it down. That was pretty neat.

Cons-
- No toddlers. This is a big deal for those of us that like to make families and legacies.
- The interactions with infants is a joke. One can't move too far from the babe's crib. Seriously. Think you're going to walk around your house with that baby? You've got another thing coming.
- The ""monster under the bed"" mechanic with children. They'll be awakened by a ""monster under the bed"" and proceed to wake up every single person in the house unless stopped. It's the most annoying thing and usually happens every night.
- Lack of visual personalization with household objects. There's a choice of different color motifs, but no choosing your own patterns and fabrics. I don't like that. Same with walls.
- There's only 2 real towns to put people in. The third town is completely empty and allows for house building. They all blend together and you'll notice people from each game coming together, which bothers me a bit.
- The game is set to automatically age people. This includes not only your current household, but any other household that you're not playing at that very moment but did create. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing with NPCs, if you've 2 households that you like to play with, they're both aging at the same rate.

So from all the ""must buy"" and ""revolutionary"" statements about the game I needed to see it for myself.

Gameplay 6 of 10

Were I to compare this to any other game in history it would have to be Super Mario World from the SNES. It is quite simply put a platform game. There are various mechanisms used and some advancement in how you go about getting from place to place, but essentially your goal is to reach the end of a level intact. The style is unfortunately the most off-putting portion of the game for me. It's not even that the game looks like a five year old designed it. It's that the general feel of the game is so simplistic, so geared toward average or casual gamers. I suppose I am still on the fringe because I can't relate to this game at all. Despite the fact that some older or hardcore type gamers find it interesting, it was clearly designed with a toddler in mind.

You play as a ""Sackboy"" who is on an adventure to somewhere through this Little Big Planet made of sackcloth, cardboard and all manner of toy box items. It is very imaginative and some will definitely consider it cute. What bothers me most about the gameplay are the limited movement options. You can run, jump and grab onto things. That's it. There is literally nothing else your sackboy can do. Jumping takes you maybe the height of sackboy off the ground at best.
Levels average out to be around 15-20 minutes each by the end of the game, depending on how difficulty and your skill level. The planet is shaped like Earth, with all our continents and countries have 4-6 levels each. So far I'd been in Central America, Japan and Europe I believe. This mostly determines the artistic style of the level and a few of the gadgets you'll use.

What you are trying to do is pick up these bubbles throughout each level. Some contain nothing (like coins from Mario) and others contain stickers and objects for decorations. And you try to get the high score for that level which you can compare with your friends and what not. These stickers can be used to decorate your box or user created levels as well as programmed levels. I did not bother with the level creator, because I wasn't that impressed with the main game and I'm not very imaginative myself.

Difficulty 8 of 10 (10 being hardest)
As many have explained, this game could not be conquered by a mere child. And I agree with the sentiment. The reason is not just because it's challenging. And this killed most of the fun for me. After playing for a few days I found myself losing interest rather quickly as the mechanics have a lot to be desired. For example when you grab onto things you have to let go to jump and opposed to jumping as you let go. Also, when you press the jump button it not's actually programmed to jump the same every time. It is the worst part of the mechanics. There is no sprint, no double jump and really no special ability at all. These are all almost obligatory in a platforming game. And in a sense, by making it more simplistic they made the game harder to complete as well. This seems counter-intuitive.

Graphics 9 of 10
The visuals in LBP are really impressive in many ways. It appears that someone dumped a toy box out and put the pieces in this game. But the shading and light and reflections really bring the brilliance of the colors to life. Graphics are definitely the crowning achievement for LBP in my opinion. They still look good compared to current games; maybe not mind blowing but very good nonetheless.

Level Design 7 of 10
I'd say the levels are definitely inventive and provide a continuous change of scenery. It can be fun for a while. And I'm sure there are some hardcore gamers that even liked this game. But once again, the game really takes a step or two back in complexity. The levels are essentially 2D with a few inches of depth, like hiding spots for the stickers. What I believe this game was really designed to do is hide a basic 2D platform game under the guise of a supposedly revolutionary 3D game which appeals to a large audience because the learning curve is so flat.

Incentives and Fun Factor 5 of 10
This is ultimately the reason I decided to get rid of this game. It offers no reason for me to replay it and the fun becomes boredom by the end. At best it is mildly entertaining to press the action button over and over. At worst it will frustrate the living daylights out of you. Stickers and decorating my cardboard box are the incentive? I'm sorry but that is easily the lamest idea of extras I've ever heard of. Outfits are really the only redeeming factor in the incentive dept. which are various in type and number. Such things as an Elizabethan outfit or the Solid Snake outfit are fun to wear but still have that persona of a toy box.

Conclusion
I can see how people are drawn to this game, but if you strip away the graphics and the level creator what are you really left with? In essence, this is IMHO Super Mario Brothers 3. In fact, it's less complex than even that. What needs to be considered is the reason why it's rated so high. One needs to really take into account the type of people reviewing this with critical acclaim. I challenge you as a potential buyer to go through the reviews and find three reviews that are a.) longer than a single paragraph (or sentence!) b.) says anything about the controls c.) from a person that has reviewed a single other game. I believe the main problem is that when a new genre is created or an old one is re-imagined people automatically tout it as amazing because they want a break from FPS games. But if you take a closer look, it's really not that impressive. There are far better platform games - Ratchet and Clank for example. I would recommend that if the artistic quality intrigues you then you should definitely rent it. But otherwise, this is a casual gamer's dream game.","Casual Gamers Rejoice, Seasoned Gamers Flee",1300060800,24,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

However, once I really started playing more into the game, I found the puzzles got harder and harder. Besides the annoying and extreme long nonsense/confusing chatter, the gameplay was only about figuring out what to do next. I can't explain but it was like there was no fun parts to this game. Each puzzle/mission was so, non logical! For just about every puzzle/part of the game, I had to look at the walkthrough! There was nothing logical about the puzzles and they were so far out, you'd never guess which object to use/combine with what. The only thing I really liked about the game, was the scenary. But that's not worth playing this game for. So I stopped 50% through. *The puzzles also reminded me of the game Memento Mori as did the game too.

Unfortunately, the controls just to move around the park are extremely annoying...my daughter doesn't even want to play it, and she asks me to navigate her around the park.  It is truly an exercise in frustration.
Now, as far as the mini-games go...they are all pretty repetitive...but...there are a few that my daughter actually kinda enjoyed.  She seemed to enjoy the princess posing game, which also snaps your pics while you do the poses...and she enjoyed the Mad Hatter/Alice In Wonderland game.  Both, ok, not too bad, but basic Kinect stuff.
But the problem lies in the fact that in order to get to these mini-games, you MUST navigate around this park...and it is huge...and as I stated before, this part of the game is extremely NOT fun.

3.0,False,"08 6, 2008",AVX1L42T98R8P,B00005ME6O,Benjamin S. Sprague,"I got SH 2 years ago. For its' time the graphics were great and the story was definetly something original no other game developer team had tried before. If you were to ask which I found more scary..being attacked by flesh eating mutants or receiving a genuine letter from a deceased loved one written AFTER they had died I'd be inclined to say the later.

Regardless that is the Dilehma James is faced with. His dead wife has lured him back to Silent-hill and you know THAT is not going to be a happy walk in the park.

First of all let me say I think this game really made people ""re-think"" the survival horror genre. It tried being witty, intelligent, and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows. Even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along. Eddie and Angela have their own interesting inner demons too and Maria looks just like James's deceased wife though her personality is drastically different. If that is not enough to sell you on this premise I could simply say ""Oh yeah this game introduces Pyramid-Head"". That alone will have people lining up in droves.

Now putting everything good about the game aside I'm going to be brave and talk about why I think while it deserves ""praise"" it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries. Yes, I know this is the game the elite Silent Snoots put on a pedestal. The one game no other SH can compare to. The Holy Grail of team silent. Is it that earth shattering?  For me anyway it was not.

As with the other games there is a suspenseful build up. First it is sounds. Then it is fleeting shadows. Finally it is full blown creatures. The only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle. Now I admit sometimes its' fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details. However in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and that's the biggest flaw of the game. In most areas I felt ""safe"" and that the monsters were easy to manuever around. Every once in awhile an eager lurching Pyramid-Head made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dread.

The true disturbing factor comes from interacting with Eddie and Angela. I will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves. These are normal people that ""snapped"" and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions. Things get stranger when you meet Maria, the sultry Dopple-ganger of Mary who embodies all Jame's sexual fantasies given flesh. Is she Jame's wife's ghost? Sadly Silent Hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find out.

As the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out James has his own dark secret. When you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why Silent Hill's foggy streets beckoned to him.

Now there is one thing I like to make clear to the fans. Pyramid Head pursued James because James subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time. PH was not manifested from James, he was merely drawn to James. This is why it is OK PH was in the movie and ok he is in SH V.

Examples

1. In origins the gillespie house had a picture of PH. Origins took place way before Jame's arrival.

2. The Room talked about ""the red devil"" and Jimmy stone. This story ties into PH if you read it carefully.

3. Another document in Origins talked about ""the executioner"" as well.

4. In SH 3 there is a picture of one of Alessa's past goddess incarnations with PH in the background amongst a few other people. You can view it in the cathedral.

I just wanted to clear that up because there is a HUGE DEBATE raging PH should be confined to only this game which I find to be a waste of breath.

As you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of Jame's sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption. If there is one thing SH 2 gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking mood.

Combat is what you expect from SH. You are not going to be able to fight like a marine. A plank with nails in it is your first weapon. That should tell you something right there. Eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy ""Plank-zorz"".  Aside from stomping on monsters when they're down you are not a golden glove brawling champion. Perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic. Besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel over-whelmed that often.

So in the end I'll say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story. If you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around, solving puzles, and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventory.",Great game if its' unique flavor is indeed your cup of tea.,1217980800,,,

In terms of innovation and originality, this goes beyond any platform/adventure game out there.  First rate.  The gameplay, itself, lacks a good deal of the substance and polish that a game of this type deserves.

First off, I must say that this game has a well earned reputation for uniqueness and creativity.  The level designs are really, really unique and at times amazing.  There are two levels that I just loved.  One required a lot amazing fast paced gliding, jumping and floating in a fun expansive environment.  Another one required you to move around a game board and then shrink and travel around the game board and convince people to join an army so you can get another board piece.  Those levels were flat out amazing and were nice breathes of fresh air.  Almost all the levels have a central theme, and many of the levels tend to stretch the boundaries of physics and gravity.  Some levels feel more like a Escher painting than a video game level.

The characters are pretty fun, the story line is a nice little compliment, and the extremely colorful levels (which represent the people's minds as you travel inside them - thus the title) are definitive stand outs in this game.  I wish most games would supply this attention to detail when it comes to visuals.

The main character  is a kid name Raz, and he travels throughout a summer camp and enters people's minds using various powers, ranging from the psychotically fun Levitation ball, to the almost useless fire starting power.  He cycles through people' minds in order to become a true Psychonaut.  Quite brilliant at some points.

Their are a lot of problems though.  The voice acting is very repetitive and many times grating.  I often had my television remote next to me so I can mute it quickly.  Almost headache inducing.  The load times are terrible.  Maybe the second worst loading times I've ever scene (Mafia for PS2 still is the worst).  One particular mission was almost an 90s point and click adventure game, where you walk around and try one thing, then walk around and try another thing and continue until you find the right item.  It may be fun for some people, but it breaks up the action.  Also, since it is so creative, it tries to do things and sometimes fail miserably.  There is one part where you follow a badly shaped bubble around the ocean and if you hit the edge, you drown.  Not fun or interesting at all.

The main problem, and it's a huge problem, is the fact the game plays like a second rate, cookie cutter platformer.  A game where the mechanics and level design are flawed enough where you feel that your main enemy is bad game design and construction rather than jumps or real enemies.  Grabbing something or landing on something on a jump almost feels random.  Double jumping is a joke that only works one out of every three times.  Camera movements often force you to make blind or awkward jumps, but more often than not, it will move unwillingly, causing you to fall as it moves in the middle of a jump.  An annoying, practical amateur mistake that destroys all possibility of enjoyment in the last third of the game.

All in all, it's a great attempt at an original game, but the rudimentary and buggy gameplay just places it in the realm of an average game.

Pros:

A couple of great levels

Original, unique, varied backgrounds

Fun concept

Levitation ball is really fun

THis is my third Xbox now and they seemed to have finally fixed the heat issue with a newer processor and more heat sinks. Xbox is brilliant; the exclusive titles are excellent, and the multi platform titles are superior on Xbox in my opinion. I have a PS3 too for Blu-ray and Sony's exclusive games, but I prefer the Xbox controller and Xbox live for COD4, AC2 etc.....and of course they have the Mass Effect series.

So with such a brilliant system, why do I give it three stars? Well for starters, they charge for Xbox live. I realize that the service is a little better than Sony's and I enjoy it a lot, but the fees seem a little excessive. Especially considering the amount of problems it encounters with big game releases.

The other gripe I have is that there's no integrated wifi connection. Seriously? Even the DS can connect to the internet, but my $300 Xbox needs a CATV cable. I've had the wireless adapter for a couple of years now and I had to pay an extra $100 bucks for it; that's absolutely insane considering it's free with all of the other gaming systems. Now they've come up with an N type adapter and they want another $100 from me; Not this time Microsoft. Fool me once...etc

Finally, I had to pay $200 for my HD player add on that is no longer supported. It's not exactly Microsofts fault that their format failed, but they sold me an obsolete feature and I have 15 HD titles; I'll take your apololgy now Microsoft. At the very least, I would expect you to accept defeat, create a Blu-ray drive and allow people who purchased the HD drive to trade it in. This is the repsonible thing to do. I thought that was the intent of not integrating the HD drive originally was so that if they lost the war then they could just make a Blu-ray one and still allow their system to have an HD movie functionality. Ehhh..whatever then; I had to buy the PS3 to play new movies.

So, what's the total damage:

1) $400 for original Xbox 360
2) Waiting a month to get a replacement (replacement failed too)
3) $400 for third Xbox 360 with two worthless games
4) $200 for obolete HD drive
5) $100 for WiFi adapter
6) $60 in replacement microphones made way too cheap
7) $50 in replacement rechargable batteries that all failed mysteriously and stopped recharging
8) $50 a year for Xbox live (4 years) = $200

Total: $1410 for my Xbox gaming experience

Oh yeah, $300 for the PS3 to play HD movies after Microsoft backed format bombed
PS3 hasn't had any issues, and Uncharted 2/ Killzone 2 were great.

I still prefer the Xbox 360 and would gladly pay another $1400 to continue playing, but I just want to make sure that potential purchasers of anything Microsoft are prepared to get screwed.

Some people have been really lucky and are still using the original Xbox without issues and connect CATV straight to it since their Router is near by. However, this has not been my experience

That is minus one star.

They throttle itself functions fine. I actually prefer the more simple design and slide motion. Less things to go wrong or break.
The hat switches are comfortably placed and easy to reach with your thumb. The three buttons on the front are placed nicely for my hand. I can use my pinky, ring, and middle finger for them and have my index finger on the hat on the front of the throttle. The amount of buttons/switches available on the throttle is fantastic.

There is no center or 50% dent. I added my own by opening the throttle and locating the half-way point and carving in a dent for the slider's ""feet"" to bump down into. I did this after trying the velcro mod others have used, which I found to be next to useless and felt awful. There are no stars off for that since the center dent is subjective. Some like it some hate it. I personally like it to have control of my reverse thrust power in space sims. I do not mind a simple mod to add one in.

The second star off is the CH Throttle input itself. In their own software it shows the limitations of the 8bit system being used with a constant ""jitter"" of the throttle axis, which is sent directly to the games. Since it happens all along the range of the throttle, there is no way to really get around. If they would update their design and parts to leave the 1980s but keep the simple functions and general configuration of the devices, these things would be a five star rave review.

For the rest of the game, players will take control of platform-centered levels with Tails and Rose, treasure-hunting with Knuckles, shoot-em up levels with Gamma, and fishing (fishing? Yes, fishing,) with Big the Cat.
The Sonic levels are by far the most fun, but have a few minor problems; namely, the camera and some slight control issues.  Sonic's homing attack sometimes gets out of hand, with Sonic floating aimlessly through the air as he looks for the enemy you told him to attack.  When Sonic builds up enough speed on some of the faster levels (like Windy Valley or Speed Highway,) it's hard to control him, so he'll be bouncing off walls.  It doesn't really slow his speed down, but it's kind of distracting all the same.
There's just not enough of the high-speed levels; playing as Tails is fun, but the Knuckles, Gamma, and Rose levels are mediocre, and the Big levels are a mess.  Give a rental first, then buy.",Good Game Hampered By Design Problems,1070668800,12,,

You are an EX Jedi Knight who served with Reven(in fact you WERE his right hand man so to speak). You and Reven ended the Mandalorian battle(not the war) at Malachoir V(That snowy Scutta says that name alot). You were cast out of the Jedi order for your misdeeds(you were awair it was wrong but used your own judgment anyway).- This is all BEFORE your main plot in the game as a player character. Dialogue choices(in flash sequence) determine WHY your character faced trial and did what he did as well as the nature of his doing this. In the present: Your dialogue effects not only you but your past KoToR 1 character as well(I won't say who he is but you wanted the plot). You can chose a man a woman either benevolent(as in Good and Kind) or Malevalant(as in Mal-adjusted misfit) as Luke-like Anakinsh or the female varient of both such as: Luke's Neimisis in Heir to the Empire sort-I like cats and in sentinal/assasin garb and grace. Superfically you chose your Light saber color and style(no 2 separate whepons but who cares, you can chose a new one(s)) As the ""Plott thickens"" and it does, believe me, Kriea gives a lot of info and finally spills her guts about the nature of things.(you do need high charisma and influence for this to happen propperly) Visas Marr is an added character for your power and Love life, but not much in the way of YOUR personal history Plot. The most pivotal character(for YOUR plot) is Bao Dur. He served with you and was YOUR right hand man.(Holding a bit of bitterness if you rub him the wrong way). You'll have to influence ALL of your crew in order to advance the plott to a coherent understanding, Otherwise, it's just a RPG hackn slash with attack bonuses and Force powers. If the credits roll up to fast, just start over and try to please your crew for more plott. Be a Sentinal for persuasion and use Charisma(not normally associated with this class) for heavy influence beyond ""Persuade"" Skill. Your compainions and NPCs on other planets alinke will break down and cry at your feet. The plot is superb!
and now part II of this long review(as long as a letter I sent ot Lucas and Obsidan via snail mail). The bugs are numorous, anyone not experiencing them Bravo, it goes without saying, I don't need to give you a cookie; but for the rest of us, It is a severe drawback and the company(s) need to fix them instead of blaming the other like finger-pointing kindergardeners they are(a trend in most big business Video game companies) Fanboys just make them work less and flaming a player instead of a company is feeding the Dark side. Green is Greed. Red is just Mad as hockey stix. And both are bad. Only True blue(truth) and Mellow Yellow(diplomacy) will work this out. I sugest buying the latest and greatest computer rig(despite what people think or tell you in locals shops) that means the Top of the Line PC and Video card(not ATI there terrible). YOu will have little problems if your Co prosessor(dual prefferabley) works them out and less likely to crash the system. Twin vid makes any failing of the drivers irrelevant as the speed is inormous(with all graphic settnigs at max). Cool your system to freezing(figuratively) as in proper fans and fan positons(not just the hardware but stradegy) Lower the front and make it suck raise the rear and make it blow. OR go watercooled as a Voodoo or a Falcon NW. Only NVidia offers Twin cards also go RAID 0 prime Hard disk(s) and a separate HD for games is a must for both stability and speed.(despite what the techs say). Taking the load off the main HD(2xRAID0) makes it focus on the OS, not the game then drive D:(so to speak) can access the game.
Finally go pentium for less cooling problems(unless water cooling your chipset --AND-- CPU BOTH). I have blown serveral AMD's bye the fact that thier fans suck and they don't sell them(for the older MB) after a year. A20mm Chipset fan is impossible to find for a AMD K7M266 for instance. KoTor 1 as well as 2 has problems on ATI drivers(not hardware) XBox also has it's share of problems(that cannot be fixed with patches) so Go nVidia to get these games running right.
Final part: The game is broken down in to serveral worlds and the sub-plotts tie in to the main plott well. Nar Shadda is a very elaborate planet in it's self and so are the others. IN KoToR 1 the pre-spaceship trip(as in Taris and Dantooine) were the big parts and the other worlds were too short and simple in KoToR 2 this is not the case, you spend endless hours on EVERY world you explore plus you have to return later to touch up on things before final confrontion. Malachoir(Mal=Messed up I guess) is your last stop(as you sort of crash there). The game uses a SIMILAR not exact 20d system as in Dungeons and Dragons. Thier is no logic in why wielding two lightsabers is penalized by your strenght lightsabers weigh nothing. Also 1.5 in the main hand for a double-blade or a single with no other is not logical. Stength in a beem of light doesn't come in to play.

- Xbox's menu system is baffling and down right confusing with so many advertisements. While the ps4 is much more straight forward.
- Controllers: Both are pretty comfortable to hold and have a 3.5mm jack. HOWEVER the Xbox you are able to put in any head phones to play the sound of whatever it is you're playing which I think is super neat. Although the ps4 has a 3.mm jack, it does not with the same way. Now the downside to the Xbox is that the controller is SUPER LOUD. Especially the D-pad. That thing has the most obnoxious clicking sound. Also these controllers require AA batteries while the Ps4 has a rechargeable controller.
- Build of the consoles: The Xbox is almost double the size and weight of the ps4. This thing isn't a brick. It's a freaking cinder block.
-Ps4 actually outputs it's games to 1080p while the Xbox most of the time runs 720p when playing games.
- Honestly the exclusive games for the Xbox haven't been that great.
-Both visited internally can record gameplay. HOWEVER Xbox can only record 5 minutes while Ps4 records an entire 15 minutes. The Ps4 NEVER ONCE FAILED me in recording gameplay. However the Xbox, just some measly 5 minutes has FAILED me SEVERAL DOZEN times. I mean straight up either didn't record or only about 30 seconds. Awful. Just awful.
- Now I am loving that Xbox is being backwards compatibility to a lot of Xbox 360 games. My previous console was a 360 so it's nice that I don't have to drag out the old console to play them. Now they only have a handful of games that are compatible but it's still growing with more to come.

The bundle of games that came with this console are ok. I really enjoy playing gears of war again since I played it back on the 360. Rare replay... Some of it is good. Others are really just not fun. Honestly I'll probably never bother with it again. Also it came in disc form? Like the console decided it had to download separate games as separate applications, so I have 15+ old games cluttering my games tab. Yet in order to play a small game I gotta take out the my other game just to play it, even though it was downloaded.
Over all the console and bundle are alright. But really, honest to god, the Ps4 just has wayyyy better specs and features. Plus it does what the Xbox does with mostly the same games besides exclusives (besides backwards compatibility).

Basically, I like games where I have a chance to compete without spending days after days racing with a crappy car because all others are undrivable (Hello GTR2) and the learning curve too steep.
I am using a Logitech G25 steering wheel and I have played most NFS games... NFS Porsche was definitely my favorite but cannot run on my Win7X64 PC. NFS Most wanted came second althought the game was way too arcade.
Dirt2 and Grid I have highly appreciated, specially Dirt2.
Oh and by the way, most of these games run very well with 3D glasses.

I bought this game quite a while ago around the same time as Grid and Dirt2 and these games felt nicer and more fun to play.
I eventually decided to give it a chance when Shift 2 got released (I suddenly remembered it).

The Pros:
- Entertaining
- Challenging
- Nice graphics
- Excellent cockpit view.
- Nice levelling of opponents with the car chosen to race. Basically you won't need to drive only the best cars to win races.
- Trajectory lane. It really helps you learning how to calculate your trajectories and help you decide when braking to avoid crashing in unexpected obstacles.

The Cons:
- Damage far from realistic... Basically it is just cosmetic and the car will behave the same after a huge crash than before.
- Loading time a bit slow and races introductions cannot be skipped.
- Stupid interface (not designed for PC).
- Opponents are sometimes a bit too aggressive.
- Car tuning is not making much sense.

Overall, a pretty good racing game. About rightly placed between simulation and arcade. I will definitely complete it before passing to the next one.

I have not yet ordered NFS Shift2 but I am looking forward to it, hoping that most criticms are due to players having no idea how to set their parameters.",Not as bad as many say,1304985600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"10 30, 2006",A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B000935256,citan-uzuki,"SCIII is a very entertaining action/fighting game.  The variety of characters and their wide array of battle moves are impressive.  Each of the characters possess weapons that have their own peculiarities and specialties.  As a result, even though the settings are recycled over and over, you will still be able to fight repeatedly without getting bored.  You can use different characters each time you play the game.  My advise here is to become competent using one character before moving on to using another.  The number of possible attack moves per character ensures that you will always have something to learn. To me, the best feature of this game is that you can also create your own characters and dress them up the way you would like to.  The attacks available to your created characters will be determined by the type of weapon they carry.

The one aspect of the game that kept me from giving it a higher score is the fact that the battle program is inconsistent.  I agree with some of the comments stating that this is a challenging game.  However, there is nothing wrong with that.  A challenging game is fun and you get a feeling of accomplishment when you finally make progress.  But you do want the game to be consistent.  You do want the game to challenge you and force you to master moves.  However, the problem with this game is that this idea is applied inconsistently throughout the battles.  To use a particular example, let's talk about Talim.  I first used Siegfried to fight Talim.  I was landing heavy blows, they were connecting, and my button presses were timed properly.  Siegfried was executing his moves properly.  I was ""chaining"" attack after attack.  Talim was stunned and was taking a lot of punishment.  Yet, she would not go down.  And then Talim lands one kick and one swipe and the next thing you know, Siegfried was knocked out! I have beaten Talim numerous times, in different modes, using Siegfried, Raphael, Ivy, and my own character.  During those many battles, I noticed the inconsistency.  It seemed to me like the game responds slowly during some battles, like there was a built-in lag in the battle system.  I noticed this when fighting against Talim and Sheong-Mina.  My characters were moving and behaving like they were in slow-motion against them.  However, they respond and react normally when playing other enemies.  It's almost like the game developers chose them to be the favored characters and added a built-in disadvantage to your player.  It really isn't the fact that the game is indeed challenging, it's the fact that you are automatically at an unfair disadvantage against these two characters.

I wanted to make sure that I have the right moves and that there was nothing that I was doing to handicap myself.  I consulted an online guide.  I also bought the Strategy Guide.  Following the advice from those sources, I used the suggested moves to keep Talim from getting close.  Again, the fact that my character became sluggish against Talim made this difficult.  The strategy is sound.  Keep a short range enemy at a distance, and use your superior ""reach"" to do damage.  The lag between my commands and the system's response kept me from accomplishing my strategy.

This is a fun game.  However, heed what some of the reviewers are saying about the battle system, or AI as one reviewer mentioned.  There is that inconsistency, which is almost like a system ""cheat"".  I have a feeling that this is what the other reviewers meant when they said that there is something wrong with the battle system.

His recent titles like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Xbox 360, and Sonic & The Secret Rings for the Nintendo Wii, haven't made a definitive smash for new gamers and the die hard fans as well. Lately, Sonic has turned his attention to sports games which have worked nicely like Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, as well as Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity for the Playstation 2. The attention has worked quite nicely for a simple twist on the blue need for hedgehog speed. Now, he has turned his sports feats into tennis and hopes to serve an ace in this title.

Sega Superstars Tennis for the Nintendo Wii, brings in a twist by bringing Sonic and his friends from classic Sega franchises into the world of tennis. In the game you can choose from classics like Dr. Robotnik A.K.A. Eggman, Sonic himself, or lesser-known friends from the Sega Universe like Akai from Super Monkey Ball and Amigo of Samba De Amigo from the classic Sega Dreamcast title. The gameplay though falls a bit similar to the Mario Tennis franchise Nintendo has made acceptionally well. The gameplay is simple, as you master you characters through simple tennis. Each character also has a specialty shoot as well, like Dr. Robotnik who throws out spiked bombs at you as he serves his shoot, and Sonic who blazes out his top speed making it impossible to reflect his shot. You can control sonic either through the Wii remote and Nunchuck where you can control your shots like you did in Wii Sports, or use the Wii's Classic controller for those who just aren't acustomed to the control of the game. There are also a few extras mini-games here that also are featured in the game, but nothing side-splitting to making it seperate from the other fantasy tennis titles.

All in all, it is a surprise Sega beat Mario in making a tennis title for the Wii, but Sega Superstars Tennis is a decent game. Sadly though, if you've mastered Mario Tennis from the Gamecube era, or a fan of other titles like Virtua Tennis, than this would be more like a rental than a must have in you Wii library.

- Feels durable
- quiet typing
- lighted keys are nifty
- a toggle key to turn windows keys on/off for gaming is appealing to me
- Macros are useful for MMORPG rotations, though a bit challenging to program with the logitech macro program

Cons:
- Keys are smaller than a standard keyboard, very disorienting to someone with large hands
- The macro keys are in a terrible place.  I often find myself reaching for the top leftmost button to press esc, but that's a macro memory key.  Same story with Ctrl for copy and pastes.  I had no idea how automatically I did that until it didn't work right anymore.
- Figuring out how to program the macros was very convoluted, and the macro program itself is not included in the box but had to be downloaded from Logitech's website

THE FRANCHISE IN A NUTSHELL:

In the beginning there was a mansion, its surrounding property, and a laboratory underneath it. That was it. The game relied on mystery, environment, it's slow-paced, high tension, moody atmosphere. You had to save ammunition (the knife is your friend) not just for stronger enemies, not just in case of a horde of zombies, but because you don't know when you will REALLY need that ammunition; in fact, you were scared to use it. Hence, the genre Survival Horror was born (some people consider Alone in the Dark the first, which may be true, but Resident Evil was the first huge success). Resident Evil 1-4 relied on this Survival Horror system. Actually, it was more or less an attitude.

Yes, I did include Resident Evil 4 as a Survival Horror game because at the beginning you have a basic handgun and a janky shotgun--which belonged to a farmer, most likely--against these people that are not acting entirely normal (yet they're not zombies, which was SO refreshing--at the time) and a gigantic ogre like boss. In Resident Evil 4 there is a real sense of John Carpenter's The Thing-esque paranoia about the odd acting residence (which is essentially very true to the title ""Resident Evil"" in the sense that you're going against these residents that are, indeed, evil; and the Japanese title still concurs with the game, too). The deeper you go in Resident Evil 4, the less scary it becomes, but that's because you've figured out the mystery and now you're trying to solve the problem. But, the first half of the game is pure horror (the first time you go into the village is probably the scariest the franchise has ever been before and after)--and then even toward the end of the game, there are still some moments of horror that will get you.

Then there was Resident Evil 5: it was about a guy who killed a bunch of angry people infected with parasites and Star Wars' misfit monsters and Agent Smith from The Matrix made an appearance, but he dyed his hair blonde. Okay, I'm joking as you know, but that doesn't mean it isn't the truth. It was a decent action game (and Mercenaries was really fun with a partner) but not a very good Resident Evil game. This was always my comparison: If Resident Evil 4 was the Casino Royale of the Resident Evil franchise (a reboot which saved a dying franchise and breathed new life into it), then Resident Evil 5 was the Quantum of Solace of the Resident Evil franchise (gimmick after gimmick and an exploitation of the previous title's changes: what that means is that Resident Evil 5 said to itself, ""Resident Evil 4 changed a lot of things, so I'm going to change even more things."" A decent action game, but a horrible Resident Evil game from almost every aspect except for its dazzling graphics.

RESIDENT EVIL 6:

I thought that Resident Evil 5 was the Quantum of Solace of the franchise . . . but I was wrong.

The game starts off without explanation: Leon and an injured girl (Helena) are in a ravaged city--zombies are everywhere and a helicopter is seemingly shooting at you. You make your way through the city only for you to realize that it was just a very interactive title and credits sequence. At the end of the gameplay you see a monster's foot and Leon says something smart like usual and then we see the title--Resident Evil 6--and now you're in the menu where you can choose your campaign or its multitude of special features.

You can initially choose from Leon's campaign, Chris's campaign, or Jake's campaign, but choose wisely because once you pick one you have to see it through to the end. But, before getting into the campaigns, I'll discuss my general thoughts about the game.

The general critiques about RE6 have been quite consistent. Imagine that you have a person with ADHD that loves action movies--but is trying to throw in horror to appeal to the fan base--and is trying to put together a very elaborate plot without the necessary skill for storytelling to tell it. The game is very unfocused; you're not sure who's the main* villain--in fact, not even the villains know who the true villains are. And when you beat the campaigns, only the least important details are explained--and even worse--in mundane manners.

THE C-VIRUS (some spoilers in third paragraph): 1/5

From the very start of the franchise what interested me more than the mutants or the zombies or the ganados/majini, was the virus or the parasite used to create such monstrosities. Resident Evil was about the T-Virus (Tyrant Virus) and, if you take Lisa Trevor into consideration, the origins of the G-Virus as well. Resident Evil 2 was about the effects the T-Virus and the G-Virus (which resulted in a form of unstable biological immortality at the cost of the human soul or consciousness); Resident Evil 3--which takes place at the same time as Resident Evil 2--continued to lay down the foundation of the T-Virus, but as opposed to showing the G-Virus (which only Leon was going against), the game focused on to what extent the T-Virus could be used for biological weaponry. For instance, the Nemesis-T Type was designed by a European branch of Umbrella to prove that T-Virus test subjects could still retain most of their intelligence. And to test out this hypothesis: Go kill all the S.T.A.R.S. members in Raccoon City so we could kill two birds with one stone. Resident Evil: Code Veronica was about the T-Veronica virus (which is a little harder to explain, but it's important to know that it's a variation of the Progenitor Virus which is the basis for all the previously mentioned viruses). I'm going to skip explaining the biological agents in Resident Evil Zero because it's essentially the same as in the first game, and finally go into Resident Evil 4, which was a game changer. The T-Virus was mentioned; Luis said that he had scene a sample at some medical center: that means that the T-Virus has been ultimately erradicated from the world; domesticated, you could say. Resident Evil 4, however, brought in a new type of biological weapon--the Las Plagas. Although many of the Las Plagas experiments in RE4 were accidental and experimental--such as the big salamander in the lake; it was just a byproduct of the experimentations taking place. And then Jack Krauser (who has a previously unknown history with Leon, but was later explained in Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles), who was previously working for Wesker, pretending to work for Saddler, actually did take a gift from Saddler--the Plagas, which he injected into himself--and became more powerful (although I think the arm injure he had obtained against Javier in Darkside was a motivating factor). At one point, he mutated his arm. The point being, all the mutations in Resident Evil 4 made sense. And then we go into Resident Evil 5: the Uroboros makes perfect sense in a biological standpoint, because such a virus would need biological matter to grow in size; but it was the Las Plagas that didn't make sense. Ricardo Irving, for instance, injected himself and became a giant sea monster . . . oh, and he just happened to be on a boat . . . how convenient.

Now, in Resident Evil 6, we have the C-Virus. Unlike in Resident Evil 1-5, I have no idea what the origins are, I have no idea how its biology works (other than it is a conductor of heat in many ways); I have no idea, partially because there are no in-game documentation about this virus or the B.O.W.'s designed from it. That's frustrating, because I don't know about you guys, but in previous games I made sure I collected every single document and I read them. At the time I didn't even like reading books (now I do, but that's not the point), but I still enjoyed furthering my experience. Is it realistic that there will be documents lying around? Probably not, but it's more realistic that some of the insane, ridiculous action sequences in this game which makes the motorcycle majini in Resident Evil 5 look like Christopher Nolan realism. Does CAPCOM think we are illiterate and can't read or don't want to read? Or, are they* the ones becoming illiterate (by the way, the game does have documents, but they can only be accessed through Special Features; I read some of the documents on the B.O.W.'s and they're not really explained intelligently, and the explanation for some of them, like the Chainsaw mutatant, was downright laughable--appearing that a thirteen year old fanboy wrote it without a sense of what they were righting would be perceived as humorous)?

The C-Virus, oh the C-Virus. The C-Virus makes zombies; the C-Virus causes zombies to become obese, causes zombies to grow strange screaming organs in their throats, causes some zombies to become Liker-wanna-bes, and causes some zombies to still wield weapons--guns and bats and golfing clubs--and to still turn cranks occasionally to hinder your process (come on!); the C-Virus causes zombie dogs--which are identical to the T-variation (but what about cats? what about deer? what about raccoons? what about birds? what about animals that escaped from the zoo?); the C-Virus creates gigantic shark mutants, mutants that are three times as large as 4's El Gigante, mutants that somehow--through a C-Virus mutation--grow a chainsaw for a hand which has its heart inside of it (I don't think Neo-Umbrella designed this one through any scientific proceedure; I honestly think it just created itself by a naturalistic evolution of the C-Virus), mutants that are ripoffs of the Iron Maiden Regenerators from Resident Evil 4, or a snake that can turn invisible; the C-Virus causes hosts who inject themselves directly to still keep their intelligence, but to grow a lot stronger and to become mutated--they're called J'avo; the C-Virus causes a J'avo to mutate into a dozen different things, ranging from Bee-headed men that can send bees at you, spider-bodied men, the growth of wings, the growth of two long legs for super jumping, the growth of explosive larvi for their entire body, and more; the C-Virus causes some J'avo to caccoon themselves and then spore new horrors--lizard things (or, you can just say its the dinosaur that killed the fat guy from Jurassic Park), bunky bohemoths with rocks for skin, flying creatures, or a swarm of insects; the C-Virus is responsible for the coolest B.O.W. since Nemesis, Ustanak, the bio-mechanic super freak . . .

But how? The game never gets into the scientific aspects of the virus. That's something that I always loved about the franchise until Resident Evil 5. Now, granted, a lot of these mutations are very cool--but hardly any of them make sense. Unless of course they went through the effort of trying to make them make sense. Why couldn't one of their campaigns have been about figuring out how ONE virus could do all these things? Another big problem is this: the C-Virus is TOO GOOD. It'll put the T-Virus, G-Virus, T-Verinica, Las Plagas, and the Uroboros out of a job. Especially since Ustanak is one of the hardest B.O.W.'s in the series. You see the problem here, don't you?

They're trying to please the fans in unintelligable ways. I'm sorry CAPCOM, I'm not that stupid. And I know there are a lot of other fans who feel the same way.

GAMEPLAY: 2/5

Those of us who were good at RE4 were probably good at RE5; both games essentially had the same gameplay mechanics, aside from RE5's clunky inventory system. Well, RE6 throws that out the window in almost every way. The gameplay is what wounds the entire game fatally. I don't mind about walking while shooting, but I do mind about the unfixed camera behind the character. It feels like I'm playing a videogame adaptation of a movie in some points of the game. The weird thing is, the creators probably thought they were helping out the player by having a fluid camera behind them at all times, but really it gives me a headache and it's hard to aim my character when I need to run somewhere. The old system had its flaws, but this new-and-supposed-to-be-improved system creates even more.

Oh, and get this. You know how you could shoot enemies in the legs in RE4 and RE5 and they fall to their knees so you can do some interesting melee attacks? Well, in RE6 you can't shoot enemies to their knees--hence, creating less melee variety. I wonder which one of the creators said to the others, ""We should definitely get rid of shooting enemies in the legs."" It's a really strange decision they made that I don't understand the point of which.

And quick time events. There are tons of them, but none of them are as good as the Leon vs. Jack Krauser scene from Resident Evil 4. A lot of people have complained about this, but I didn't mind. I was just never blown away, aside from the final Ustanak battle at the end of Jake's campaign. That was innovative, I must say.

LEON AND HELENA: 4/5

Have you ever read an over bloated novel that could have been a whole lot better if the author cut out at least 25% of it? Well, that's what Leon's campaign felt like. His campaign is deliberately designed for the Survival Horror Resident Evil fan--you know, the gamers that likely hate on RE4 and RE5 because they have no Survival Horror (or a lack of); ""zombies"" return only* in Leon's campaign, and it also features some really cool zombie-variations (although I couldn't help but compare most of them to Left 4 Dead's super zombies). Leon's campaign starts off in an intense situation without much explanation, then travels through a zombie infested Tall Oaks, goes to a church which happens to have an underground laboratory underneath (there is sort of* a reason for this), then goes to China (which he randomly and too conveniently reunites with an old acquaintance immediately after the rough landing of the plane, which will undoubtedly make the player giggle with how unlikely the by-chance meeting really is).

Leon's campaign is the heart of Resident Evil 6. Leon knows Sherry, Leon knows Chris, Leon has a thing for Ada (who seemingly is/isn't the villain in the game), and by theory does the most important things in the game. The game's creator(s) deliberately did this because Resident Evil 4 was the most successful in the franchise.

The highlight of Leon's campaign is the atmosphere; the flaw is its overly bloated length (this campaign feels as long as Resident Evil 5 as a whole, and yet there are still two other campaigns--technically three more--to go).

CHRIS AND PIERS: 2/5

The first thing that you will ask is: what the heck happened to Jill Valentine? And who the heck is Piers? The game never answers those two questions, but it only hints at the fact that Chris never gave up the fight against bioterrorism after he saved the world from the Uroboros. It's a little jarring when we first see Chris Redfield; he's lost his memory and he acts like a depressed Tony Stark drinking and smoking himself to death in a bar in some country. Piers was his old partner and he recruits Chris back into the force (why didn't they just have Jill Valentine instead? I really don't know). Piers is one of the least likeable characters in the franchise  just because of how bland he is and really has no purpose in the story or the history of the franchise. I would have at least liked some references to what happened to Jill Valentine, but I was left unsatisfied.

To say the least--and without spoilers--Chris's story is structured oddly; but, moving on from that, there is only one strength to his campaign. And that's when he and his team go into a building to chase a snake B.O.W.. It did not contribute to the plot at all (which is good, because RE6 is soooooo plot heavy that it gives me a headache); nope, Chris is just in a frenzy to chase down this snake B.O.W. at all costs (and it's no doubt a shout out to the first Resident Evil game). It's actually when Chris is walking the ""screenwriters"" path to keep the plot moving when I care the least about what's happening.  The problem with Chris's campaign is that they--the creators of the game--forced his purpose in the game (I'd like to say more, but that would include spoilers) by giving him personal vendetta instead of just doing his job. A BSAA operative's purpose is to kill B.O.W.'s and to rescue civilians--it would have been a lot simpler if that's what Chris's purpose in the game was, instead of being so plot driven.

Ultimately Chris's campaign is a narrative mess. They tried way too hard with his personality, his past (by ignoring a lot of it), his purpose, etc.. Instead of just letting him do what he does best . . . kill B.O.W.'s and then--and ONLY then--discover what's going on in the grand scheme of things. The ONLY redemptive quality about his campaign was hunting the snake: that felt like survival horror. Although, on that note, I wish that Chris could have been able to save more of his team. There's no reward in inevitable cutscenes killing off the team. In that sense, CAPCOM is the monster, not the snake. In this Skyrim day and age, players need to be rewarded or punished for in game choices.

JAKE AND SHERRY: 3/5

Let me say this right off the bat. Only one element to this campaign makes it worthy of playing: the Nemesis-esque bio-mechanical B.O.W. which was designed and programmed for one thing and one thing only: to capture Jake Muller. Why? Well, if it hadn't been for most of the trailers of the game, then it would be a spoiler, but since everyone knows, it isn't a spoiler anymore. Jake Muller is Wesker's son. That's why he's important. Sherry Birkin magically finds him in a European country (she wasn't--but somehow was--trying to find him from the beginning. It's hard to explain. It goes back to a similar awkward narrative that the Chris campaign had). And she knows that he has rare antibodies that can save the world. Talk about taking it slow and letting the player discover the mystery on their own, which is a huge problem the game has in general . . . it treats the audience like everyone is a Michael Bay fan and doesn't care about story and characters, but only the spectacle and thrilling events. I think the usually-good-reviews that RE5 had sort of enforced this ideology that not-everything-has-to-make-sense-because-the-fanbase-doesn't-care-too-much-about-logic (why CAPCOM? Are you saying I'm stupid or just complacent with the mundane?)-just-give-them-zombies-and-they'll-be-satisfied. Honestly, I wish the creators took care in their story as if I was watching a Christopher Nolan film instead of a Michael Bay film. I think the Resident Evil fan base is too smart for some of the very illogical ""moments""/plot elements in RE6; a lot of which are in Jake's and Sherry's campaign.

What I found most annoying about this campaign is that I thought it would answer the most questions, such as what ""Ada Wong"" is up to, and Jake's origins and what about the crazy awesome Ustanak B.O.W.? As cool as these questions are, none of them are really answered at all. They're half-baked ideas that never really formed.

When I played the Leon campaign, I thought that Chris's and Jake's campaigns would make sense out of a lot of random B.O.W.'s and plot events; when I played the Chris campaign, nothing was answered, so I was thrilled that the Jake campaign would answer everything. Nope. Not at all. His blood is important and that's all that you* need to know.

CONCLUSION:

There are moments in the game that are better than any moments from any of the other games. In fact, if they had trimmed anywhere from 25% to 50% of the game, then maybe this game would be just as good--if not better--than Resident Evil 4. But the problem is this: think of RE6 as a buffet, but you can't choose what you eat; you have to eat in a random--but set--order. If green beans are first, you gotta eat them. Then cheesecake could be next (AWESOME), and then . . . you gotta eat piss and snot soup (EEWWW), and then some tasty Chinese food, and then fried poop. You see, it's the highs and lows of the game which makes it so disappointing. I could have forgiven the clunky controls and awkward inventory if they cut out all the mundane aspects of the campaigns, making them more to the point, even if each campaign was cut in half. Then it would have been an amazing game.

But it's all the crap (no pun intended) that you're force to eat which makes it so frustrating at times; for instance, in the Leon campaign, there's a part where you have to chase a zombie dog around a graveyard (spooky, right? You're in a graveyard, so it HAS to be spooky--and there's lightning, too) because it has the key . . . and somehow it's smart enough to know that you need it and it runs away and doesn't attack you. And it's all the illogical inclusions of B.O.W.'s (that are cool, mind you, but without purpose) which makes me feel like I'm watching a Paul W.S. Anderson adaptation. Then there are all the pacing issues too. It's such a fast paced game that you can't stop and smell the flowers and enjoy--and be disturbed by--the horrific terrain and scary atmosphere. CAPCOM tried to do way too much. They cannot make this the scariest game in the franchise and a high octane thrill ride at the same time. They need to get off the fence and decide what they want to do. And I hope it's the former, and not the latter for the next game.

WAYS TO SAVE THE DYING FRANCHISE:

In the beginning of my review, I referenced 28 Days Later. The reason is, CAPCOM is trying to cure the franchise without truly understanding. Yes, they listened to some complaints, but ignored others. Yes, Ustanak is an amazing B.O.W.; yes, Chris isn't so bulky anymore; yes, zombies have returned (sort of); yes, they tried. But they weren't very smart in the sense that they don't understand their own franchise and they exploited beloved characters to the point of ridiculousness. Must they deliberately hire a few fans to be the creative directors in the next game? Does it need to come down to that? At this rate . . . absolutely. If they want RE7 to survive. Otherwise, there's no hope left.

Resident Evil is not Uncharted, it's not Gears of War, it's not Call of Duty, it's not a racecar game, it's not an on-rails shooter. Resident Evil, from 1-4, has always been about exploration and horror, stumbling onto a mystery and trying to solve it, and survival. While Resident Evil 5 was not a Survival Horror game, it did attempt to stay true to Resident Evil 4. It didn't take enough risks, mind you, but it didn't step backwards either (the only* gripe I have with RE5 is some of the story decisions and how Wesker could teleport).

Resident Evil 7 needs to take a step back. No they need to take a couple hundred meters back and objectively and subjectively look at the franchise. What works? What doesn't work? Horror works. Too much action doesn't. RE6 had so much environmental action to the point of predictability--such as walking across a bridge, you knew it would fall--but the thing about predictability is that it isn't scary. Actually with the environment going haywire while playing the game, it could be looked upon as a Final Destination videogame adaptation too (really). RE6 failed to understand that having awesomely grotesque monsters doesn't make it a scary game (such as being in a graveyard while there's lightning). Pacing is what makes games scary. Why were the first few games so scary? Not because of what happened, but because of what didn't* happen. In RE6 too much happened.

Resident Evil 7 needs to be shorter (gasp!) and to the point. There needs to be a clear cut villain or two or three (like in RE4), and a sense of exploration and difficulty. If Resident Evil 7 took some RPG elements and throw in Dark Souls-esque difficulty and strategy, it could be the greatest game of all time; but--and this is probably scary for CAPCOM--they need another reboot. They must if they want to survive, because for RE7, I'm going to be smart enough to read the reviews first, and if it's not a good game--and if it's not a horror game--I'm not going to buy it. And I consider myself a diehard fan. I've beaten Resident Evil 4 20+ times and can't think of any flaws; I played Resident Evil 5 twice before realizing it was a little bit of a disappointment; I played only the Leon S. Kennedy campaign to realize that Resident Evil 6 was simply not a great game. RE6 felt like it was essentially an on-rails game: there's no straying from the path and no sense of exploring the area. Why not have a few houses available to go through to see if there is anything of use?

And for the love of God, bring back the merchant. I hate ""buying"" things on a screen. It might not make a whole lot of sense how he can transport as quickly as you can, but at least the buying/selling process makes sense with the merchant. Also they could give him a backstory too, because clearly he isn't entirely human. And if your character learns skills, then why not have random BSAA operatives around the city which know skills that you can learn from? Maybe Erickson with a broken leg and hiding on a roof can teach you a move or give you a gun if you find him crutches in the city (but without any cookie crumb trail system to lead you the way; let the players find it themselves), and the possibilities could go on forever. Kind of like in Skyrim. And speaking of which, it needs to have a lot more RPG elements.

All in all, CAPCOM needs to slow it down for Resident Evil 7. Resident Evil fans (unless they're fans of the films, too) generally are patient people: that's why they're Resident Evil fans. In the first five or six games, there was a lot of walking around, not knowing what to do exactly; there were a lot of puzzles and a lot of backtracking. So why are the creators treating us like we have ADHD and no attention span and no intelligence at all? Seriously, Resident Evil fans don't need (and generally don't want) non-stop action; we don't need the cookie crumb trail system to tell us where to go (we like finding our own way); we like to play a Resident Evil game and have a sense of accomplishment afterward, like the effect that Dark Souls has--with difficulty comes rewarding accomplishment. Come on CAPCOM. Know who your fans are. Don't assume that we're all Paul W.S. Anderson fans. Some of us expected a Christopher Nolan-esque tale, not another Schumaker game where the characters have rubber nipples on their suits. The creator of the series mentioned recently that the fans and the creators have like two parents trying to do what's best for their kid, and that they're going to disagree with one another. Come on, CAPCOM! That's a very unfair thing to say, because we're the ones who made you successful, and we are--for the most part--flat out telling you guys that you're going too far. If the fans and the creators are like two parents that disagree with one another, then CAPCOM is trying to make our broad shouldered son into a dancer instead of a football player, which is what he does best. Resident Evil is not meant to be as ridiculous as its Paul W.S. Anderson film counterparts, end of story.

IN A NUTSHELL:

Pros:
1) Great dialogue
2) Terrifying creature designs
3) Enemy variety
4) Atmosphere
5) Really great moments
6) The partner system is fixed (although I'd prefer without one)
7) Imaginative boss battles
8) Fantastic cutscenes
9) Ustanak

Cons:
1) Inventory (a step down from RE5)
2) Melee is too convenient, and thus not rewarding
3) Controls are clunky, camera fluidity is irksome
4) Mundane tasks (chasing a zombie dog around a cemetary)
5) Forced plot (they meet up in the darnest spots)
6) No in-game documents (which would help make sense out of some random B.O.W.'s)
7) No typewriters (but it's such an on-rails game, why would it matter?)
8) No treasures (which makes buying skills VERY difficult)
9) No point in exploration (BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREASURES OR DOCUMENTS!)
10) No merchant (come on, CAPCOM, bring the man back)
11) The C-Virus (the T-Virus has children to feed; you're putting it out of a job)
12) Too long (with too many mundane moments in all the chapters to even revisit)
 - On that note, the campaigns are so long that it would be a task to replay any of the campaigns.
13) Not scary (although it had its moments)
14) Confusing plot elements
15) Too much action (seriously, this is Michael Bay's Resident Evil; I'd prefer Christopher Nolan's or Frank Darabont's)

This controller allows them to rest on either side of me. You can also set this controller to the same input as your dualshock Eg. 1. That way you can have a dualshock in your right hand and the fragchuck in your left. I love the ""fragchuck"". It fits well in hand and everything for the left hand is there, plus motion sensitivity, macros, rapid fire, and more! Could pack 2-3 more buttons in, though.

The mouse feels good, the buttons take a little getting used to, but are intuitive and easy to adapt to. The mous pad is good too. However, it's a little too big for me and I have good sized hands - 7 inches from my middle finger to the bottom of my palm. Because of the shape, It actually fits better in my left hand than my right, of course then the buttons are imposable to use. I could have gotton used to the size but didn't want to since it wasen't very compatable with some of my games (See details section below).

There is a lot of disinformation surrounding this product. There are a lot of positive reviews from people playing Calld of Duty (Newer ones) and a lot of bad reviews calling it a ""rip off"".  Aparently compatbility is hit or miss since PS3 was not made for a mouse and the fragfx shark has to emulate a thumb stick. To be fair to Splitfish they made a niche product, great for some of todays most popular games, but it's game manufacturers that are not making their titles compatible with Splitfish controllers. But then, why should they? It is a 3rd party controller. Also, why would Sony make the PS3 compatable with mice when most console gamers like the dualshock 3? I should add that some users don't like to use mice and the only refuge they have from the advantage a mouse gives users is on a console.

Pros:
- The Concept is sound
- Wireless, no lag
- The design looks sweet
- The ""fragchuck"" is almost perfect!
- Great Battery life
- Works with some F.P.S. games

Cons:
- Price!!!
- Dosen't work with some F.P.S. games
- PS3 Games were ment for Dualshock controllers
- 3rd parties don't get much support from developers
- OK as an optical mouse (Not great, Not laser)
- Mouse is a little too big in my opinion
- Disinformation about it

THE BOTTOM LINE: DOES IT WORK, AND IS IT WORTH $89?
- Yes and no to both points! It works with some games and not with others. It may be worth it if your game is supported, you get past the learning curve, and you really want to take your ""hard core"" gameing up a level, or if you seriously want to get into PC gaming without the keboard. Otherwise, it's not for you and you will end up unsatisfied. I suggest you keep everything, and thouroughly test out all your games as soon as you get it, then you can get a refund if it does not meet your expectations.

Price I would consider keeping it for (Opinion):
- $34.99
Price I would buy the Fragchuck alone (Opinion):
- $29.99

DETAILS:
There was no combination of ingame look sensitivity and ""dead zone"" sensitivity that removed diagonal ""staircasing"" without making tracking too slow for most of the games I've tested. I saw reviews that mentioned the same thing before I purchased. I decided to give it a try anyway. To their defence, I tried evey combination of dead zone to ingame look sensitivity in the games below with limited success.

Homefront (Demo):
- Staircased at dead zones of 0-5 and required too much mouse tracking with 6-9. 6.5 was almost workable except it required me to repeatedly pick up the mouse and reset it to look around. Was less efiecient than the dualshock.

Call of Duty: Classic
- Same as aboave, but worse.

Call of Duty: Black Ops (Demo)
- Works really well but seems to move up/Down slower than lept/right. No staircasing/jittering with ingame sensitvity at max (Insane) and deadzone = 3. Workable but will take some getting used to. Recommended for this game but it's not perfect.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Demo)
- Same as black ops aboave. Abviously, these are the game it was intended for.

Killzone 2 (Demo):
- I was able to resolve staircasing and jittering. Requires maximum ingame sensitivity and a deadzone of 4. Too slow of movement, mouse has to be picked up and drageed all over in this one. Not recomended.

Killzone 3 (Demo):
- Better than above but not as good as COD:MW2 or black ops. It is still too slow. too much mouse tracking.

Battlefield 1943:
- No staircasing. I needed a dead zone of about 3 to get rid of the jittery/jumping when trying to ""pixle point"" at an object. Although better, I found tracking was still too slow/difficult to play with. Would take some getting used to. It makes driving vehicals or flying extreemly difficult, if not imposable.

Infamous:
- Works well enough to play. Better feel than the dualshock but jittery/staircasing not completly gone.

PC USERS:
When set as a mouse it is fine, sweet to have four extra buttons! Not as good as my logetech MX 5000 laser mouse but  it tracks as well as an optical (A cheap one). Also, since I was a console gamer before PC, I tried this on a game I have always dreamed of having a ""fragchuck"" for...The Descent series. Although windows 7 x64 recognizes it as a gamepad and all of the buttons/analog stick work, it would not recognize the anolog or mouse movement in Descent 1. In Descent 2 this problem is fixed but the mouse has dead zone issues, and when that is ajusted it's too slow, requires too much movement, and isn't as accurate as my MX5000 laser (Not even close). So, it was esentially useless. Too bad! Fine, I can just use the MX5000 instead by choosing the mouse and joystick option. Worked perfect, very addicting. I set drop bombs to the motion sensative melee and afterburners to the joystick button (L3)! That is sweet and there are 10 buttons on the fragchuck, if you count L3 and the D-Pad, to assign functions to. They could have packed 2-3 more buttons in though. I also, tested a few other FPS games (Older School) that did not work to my satisfaction. Bottom line: if your game supports joystick and mouse operation in tandom (and gives you complete control over button reassignments) then it ""might"" work like you want it to, otherwise it's a crap shoot. Don't know about newer games like far cry, fallout, and etc.

Note:
I really wanted it to work for me and to give it a fair review. I even pulled it back out of the return box to test it agian on a few titles I forgot about, just to make sure I wanted to return it. No go. Given the range of experiance I got out of it and the problems I was able to almost resolve, I would say my unit was not defective. It just almost works. Maybe it will work better for the games you want it for. Good Luck.

It was the first of its kind to be developed as a ""true"" Vita Lego game from the ground up. What does this amount to? The same PSP style graphics engine that so many have claimed these games have. The cutscenes are as grainy as an 80s VHS classic, the on-screen text is not crisp or clear, and the inclusion of movie script and audio clips, though commendable, is not done quite right. It seemed like a great idea, but in more instances than one, it comes across awkward and out-of-place.

This review is purely based on the Vita version. I know that previous Lego games on the PS3 still incorporated cutscenes that were movies, not in game graphics engine software at work. Maybe these just translate poorly on a Vita system. Maybe the option to have High-Definition movies on a Vita cartridge are too much to ask and costly to create regarding disk space. But that is no excuse for games that look hazy and dated in terms of graphics technology. This is a Lego game. Not an Uncharted sequel. I'm not asking for much, but a little more than what was provided would have been considerate.

My intentions regarding this purchase are to trade it in when I complete the game, or when I can no longer enjoy it on the platform.

The tracklist is actually surprisingly diverse given that the expansion pack is genre-based, with the painfully-metal ""Holy Diver"" from Dio, a pop infusion of ""We Got the Beat"" by the Go-Go's, and even ""Play With Me"" by Extreme (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure aficionados will recognize that little number, and believe me, it belongs in the final slot).

The tracklist it not the problem, however; the issue I take with it (as many others have) is that the game is priced at ""full game"" level while only offering the basics of an expansion pack.  There are the same characters and guitars and skins, but no unlockable songs, no local band stuff, no crazy changes that made Guitar Hero II an exciting release.  I felt comfortable paying fifty bucks for Guitar Hero II because in addition to a 40-song setlist, I was getting dozens of other songs, essentially doubling my repertoire.

However, the Premium Edition is less. . .yeah, it's just a bad deal. The extras are crap, it's basically paying an extra 20 USD or so for the box. Just wasn't worth it, in any way at all.

That said, the game is good, the core aspects have directly addressed a few issues I had with 3, especially viz a viz the optimization. The graphics, while technically less impressive, look better by and large, the UI is lovely, and so forth -- nice. The gameplay has done a decent job of saying ""Remaking the Sims 2 or 3 but with a new engine is just silly, we need a new Sims game in-of-itself, so let's pick our favourite general ideas and start over"" At least, that's totally what I get from it. YMMV and all, but I have no doubt that actually including everything within the Sims 3 would, not only have been a nightmare, but prohibitively expensive. It seems like they decided to do more, with less, this time around, and I say they succeeded.

Moving from Sims 3 to Sims 4 is much more like moving from Sims 1 to Sims 2 (especially the console versions, which I also play religiously).

The best thing I can say about this game is this: If one of the expansions has any kind of (flexible) story scaffolding added for either your household, or the other sims at least, then this will be my new favourite Sims game (notice that says favourite, not best).

It offers a futuristic backdrop, dismal and chaotic, for the player to enjoy. Zombies looks awesome, as does the Dead Ops Arcade. There is also a single or multiplayer campaign called Nightmares, featuring more zombies. The graphics shine. The smaller maps allows the processor to be able to render characters and objects quickly. Everything runs smoothly. Multiplayer is now limited to a max of 6v6 and it offers a wealth of game types (Domination, Capture Flag, etc.) You can also spend COD points in the Dark Market on perks and unlocks.

Negatives: Not necessarily negative but the game clearly has been influenced by Destiny (and even Mass Effect). Characters look like cyborgs and other strange alien designs. Colors are interestingly vibrant and showy in a situation where you'd probably be better off wearing camo. I'm disappointed by the smaller maps and team sizes. I used to like the 12v12. It seems like the entire map is a kill box, no room to maneuver or pause. BOP3 is meant to be played fast. I also did not enjoy the wall running and jetpacking. Too much to focus on while I'm just trying to get a kill.

Conclusion: BOP3 is a decent game. Looks great but seems to have an identity crisis, like it's trying to look like Destiny.

First of all, it's pretty short. 11 missions, and not very long missions at that. The a.i. is tolerable, but the only reason the a.i. gets you is because the game throws wave after wave of them at you, not because they're actually intelligent. I breezed through the first half of the game, but then it got tedious. There's a part where you are out amongst cranes and crates trying to fight off snipers on the roofs. Problem is, you can't really see them, and there's so many of them you can't get out a shot without being torn to shreds. It's sort of like EA thought that part in Half-Life where you fight those fast ninja-like assassins was really great and they'd try knocking it off. It failed.

Mostly, the last half of the game felt like that. EA being cheap to make up for poor a.i. and me just speeding through everything I could, taking plenty of damage, but squeezing out nonetheless.

You get to drive an underwater version of the Aston Martin in the game too. It's cool for the first minute and a half, but then you have to navigate through an underwater mine field in a very tight tunnel and that's when the icky control problems really make themselves known and next thing you know KABOOM.

But there are some fun parts. The tutorial mission is actually quite good. I had a blast on the first rail shooter level, and the first vehicle driving level. The level where you fight your way down the skyscraper is intense and fun.

The multiplayer is decent, but EA's little GOOD or BAD thing is here again, as it was in The World is Not Enough for N64. This means Bond is GOOD, and so are the Bond girls, and so they cannot fight each other. Ever. The BAD players can fight each other all they want, because, you know, BAD people do that. But not GOOD. Nope. This is annoying because you get your round setup and everything, and you're like ""THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL"" and then it tells you that you can't have GOOD players fighting each other. It's even worse than it was in TWINE, too, because TWINE at least had a lot of characters.

The multiplayer levels are kinda blah, too. And there's not many of them.

The bots are ok because you can alter the characterstics of the generic characters. Sadly, you can't do this for the characters you unlock which is annoying.

The gamemodes they introduced probably seemed good when they were making them, but they're not very good here. Goldeneye strike, where you collect two halves of the goldeneye key and one person is automatically struck dead, sounds pretty neat, yeah? Too bad it's kinda confusing, and the deaths are very anticlimatic. King of the Hill would be good if it had a Mobile Hill option instead of just fighting it out in one spot the whole time.

But still, there is at least an ounce of fun in here. If you like James Bond, you should get this, because it's cheap and you'll enjoy it every now and then. Or, better yet, if you want an EA Bond, get the first shooter they made, The World is Not Enough on N64.

The background characters on the streets feel like they were ripped out of 2002's Vice City. This is an 08 game and it feels six years old. You level up your chacacter in a contrived, story driven narrative that looks choppy and unfinished. The plot is paper thin and the graphics do not look good for it's time. The enemy AI borders on annoying, with tanks that can shoot you down, helecopters that can shoot you through buildings, and agents that can sense you even though you are disguised... It is disjointing to be slaying the undead horde when a tank appears and shoots you even though you are dressed as a soldier.

It makes up for that with the gameplay. You get powers as you play... cool powers. You can jump from building top to building top, turn your arms into vicious weapons, take over tanks and helecopters (Nothing else I'm afraid), and EAT PEOPLE with your tentical powers!

It's followed me since as it seems that every time I walk into a Gamestop I see a copy sitting on their used game shelf.  What always struck me is how much the cover art gave me a Macross (Robotech, for the uninitiated) type of vibe...and that maintained my curiosity.

Well, I finally purchased a new copy of this game from Amazon at a very cheap price.  I popped it into my Xbox 360 and it pretty much lived up to my expectations.  This isn't a rail style space shooter in the vein of Star Fox, nor is it an overhead shooter like the original Sylpheed.  It is a fully 3D styled space shooter that allows you to manuever and rotate on every axis.  Cool, but it's this concept makes it very difficult to assess your location and where the action or next objective is at.  Having to constantly seek out what's next really slows the flow of the title and makes it a tad boring.

What I also found disappointing, by no fault of the game...just my unrealistic expectations, is that this game didn't really remind me of a Macross game.  In the late 90s and early 2000s I was crazy about an import title called Macross VF-X 2 (it's US release was cancelled, woefully) and I kinda thought this game would capture some of that magic, despite VF-X 2 being a flawed game.  Meh, not really.  Though, like I said, that is an unrealistic expectation on my part.

3.0,False,"12 1, 2005",A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B000AA878M,Lestor neeker Wong,"You'll probably enjoy this game if you're a fan of Agatha Christie. Otherwise, you'll find And Then There Were None a journey of boredom. To put it simply, there aren't really many things to do in this game apart from walking around, picking up items, and then using them. Yes, this basically sounds like a typical point-and-click adventure game, but one can't help but feel that the developer could've given the game a better boost in terms of gameplay.

Based on Christie's popular novel of the same title, And Then There Were None puts ten people on a desolated island, and has them killed off one by one by their invisible host. Playing as the 11th man, you've to find out the truth before the murderer kills them all. You do so by exploring the various areas on the island, including the mansion where the lot of you stays in, and its surroundings. Unfortunately, there aren't much you can do to prevent the deaths of these people, not until late in the game at least. As such, most of the time, you'll be simply exploring areas for conversations and events to trigger the beginning of the next chapter of the game. Before long, you'll be wondering why do you even bother.

The good thing of this game is that it offers a different murderer (and motive) than what the book prescribed. This would certainly please Christie fans, who must have read the book several times before playing the game. Also, depending on what you do during the later part of the game, you've the opportunity to save some characters, and therefore unlock different endings. Regardless of which ending you achieve, however, you'll get to solve a last puzzle to view the original ending, so players who've not read the book can still admire at how amazing the plot is.

What the game really lacks is a better challenge. Despite being an adventure game, the amount of puzzles to solve is few and far between. They're also extremely easy to solve, making the experience more like going through the motion at times. Players who're expecting a reasonable amount of challenge could find themselves really disappointed by this game.

The situation isn't help by some inept attempts at graphical and audio presentations. The characters modeling look decidedly slipshod, even though you do have an option to sharpen their features in the main menu. Needless to say, this requires more memory from your PC. Therefore, if you prefer more defined looking characters, and don't have a high-end machine to run the game, you may have to do without them. The music is actually quite nice, and fits the mood of the game greatly. However, there's only one number throughout, and two chapters into the game, you'll be wondering whether you'll have to listen to this for the full ten chapters. The answer is yes.

Now, it may sound like I'm slating this game throughout this article, but that's hardly so. I enjoy the game despite its flaws, and I thought it was a credible effort from The Adventure Company on the whole. However, as a Christie fan, I find the game too ordinary for gamers who're not fans of her to engage in. At times, it feels like a trimmed down version of Trace Memory (for the DS), albeit with much lesser puzzles to solve. I'd still recommend this game for Christie fans though, if only as a tribute to the author. Otherwise, you should consider other options. That said, I do hope to see more of her books get adapted into adventure games in future, since it's a genre that I particularly enjoy.

And for that game, I hope that's it's a little more difficult than this one.","An ok tribute to Agatha Christie, but could have been better.",1133395200,55,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I've tried out most of the races and several of the classes.  The races look interesting and different from one another but are fairly generic when it comes to stats and unique abilities.  I appreciated the variety of classes to choose from, especially the Hunter and Warlock.  The game world is huge and could easily occupy hundreds of hours of playtime.  I think I enjoyed the professions the most.  Mining precious metals for jewelcrafting or hunting animals to skin for leatherworking is a game within itself.

Its really important to have some friends to play with in this game.  Completing quests alone gets pretty tedious when you don't have anyone to talk to and fight with.  Having friends is also helpful in the dungeons, which I found to be the most entertaining and challenging part of the game.

What I disliked about this game is that it is lacking true RPG elements.  Sure, you gain experience from quests and defeating enemies but you have no control over how you allocate your character's stats other than choosing new spells or abilities and professions.  I'm used to being able to customize every aspect of my character in an RPG, not having everything automatically picked for me.  WoW also lacks any coherent storyline or character development.  I would start a new character, receive cursory background information and then would be thrust into a new land to complete mindless tasks.  Quests entail finding an NPC and then either gathering x amount of items or killing x amount of creatures or a boss.  Repeat this process over and over again.

I don't see how Blizzard can charge a high monthly fee for this game when it boasts of having millions of subscribers but that is beside the point.  This game just isn't entertaining or addicting enough to justify buying the actual game and then paying twelve to fifteen dollars a month just to play it.

If you buy the disc version, you are required to install a mandatory 6 gb of game data.  Since the install data is almost about the size of the actual game, I'm not sure this Edition is even worth it if hard drive space is a concern for you.  The only positives I see now in owning the disc is that you get a cool slip cover, can save maybe 2 gb of hard drive space on your PS3, and have the option to maybe sell it later on down the line.  In my new honest opinion, while you can probably find a physical copy for relatively cheap, if you really want it and don't plan on selling it, wait for it to go half off on the Playstation store.  To own a copy where you're only saving 1.5 gbs of hard drive space just seems ridiculous to me.  The developers obviously had a hard time programming this game for PS3. DMC 4 had the same issue.  There's really no excuse if other titles like Uncharted, Dead Space, NBA 2k, and many more hardly take up any space.  For that, I'm lowering the game's overall review.)

After buying the Limited Edition, I was a little bitter about this re-release.  But after selling it and purchasing this version, I'm pretty fine with it.  All content released for the game, including Versus mode, is made available and I pretty much prefer that than downloads.  Since my old save file still works,  I can't complain.

Strangely I found the 2 Extra Bonus Chapters to be more enjoyable than the actual title itself.  They did a better job of invoking the feelings I thought Resident Evil 5 could have done better.  ""Lost in Nightmares"" has the old school scary Resident Evil vibe we're all used to. It's what Resident Evil 5 should have been.  My only gripes with it were that I wish it was longer and had more enemies.  Nevertheless it somewhat fills the void for those who miss the old titles and not being able to play as Jill in the main campaign.  ""Desperate Escape"" is the more action oriented chapter of the two, not scary, but intense.  What ""Lost in Nightmares"" lacks in enemies is all made up for in ""Desperate Escape"".  These extra chapters improve on the main campaign in bite-sized chunks.

This Gold edition also adds a new mercenaries reunion mode featuring past characters like Barry and Rebecca.  It's a nice throw-back for past Resident Evil fans like myself.  Unfortunately, though, characters aren't interchangeable within each mode.  Each mode is fixed with its set of characters.

Your old save file still works, but requires a new install of 6gb.  You can delete your old 5gb install.  The installs are rather big for the added content, so that could be a problem for some.  If you don't want to buy, there's a complete bundle on PSN.  Just know you're missing out on a Cool Slip cover with Chris and Jill on it if you choose not to.  If you're a hardcore RE fan or haven't gotten the game yet, definitely pick this version.","Definitive Version, but wait for the discount on PSN if you really want it.",1270944000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The thing that made Star Wars Battlefront so amazing was the fact that the player could do anything; you could choose which command posts to take, you could choose your character class, etc.  You could choose whether or not you wanted to destroy the shield bunker on Endor.  You could choose whether or not you wanted to blow up all three techno union ships on Geonosis.  Battlefront 2 completely takes this feeling away.  Now you have to do objectives in a certain order, going from one place to the next in an organized sequence.  You cannot move freely from one command post to another.  You do everything you are told, and that is one of the major flaws in Battlefront 2.

  What's worse: on campaign mode, you're timed!  That's right; you have a certain time to complete each map and go to the next.  This is one of the lamest things in the game.  Again: it removes the ability to move freely on the battlefield.  This timing nuisance and the objectives are what have influenced me to remove a star from the game's overall rating.

Another star is lost because of the character classes.  I liked using the diverse characters in Battlefront 1.  When i was playing as the Rebels, I always used the wookie smuggler, because of the cool bowcaster weapon, its special grenade launcher, and the time bombs you could use to strategically take out bases and vehicles.  When I was the empire, I used two classes: the dark trooper and the imperial pilot.  The Dark Trooper was special because he could super-jump, and he had a wide-range blast cannon.  The imperial pilot was especially difficult to use because the mortar launcher required good precision, and he also could fix machines and could drop health and ammo canisters.

  I also like the droid pilot for the same reason.  And as for the Republic, I always used the jet trooper, because he could fly and launch EMP's.  All these character classes were not only unique, but very balanced and are only effective if used in the right hands.

Yeah...about that...you cannot use ANY of those in Battefront 2 unless you unlcok them by achieving a set amount of goals (like kills, etc.) in a map.  You only start out with the same borng classes for every army, like the standard trooper, the sniper, the rocket launcher-carrier, and a new class that repairs vehicles.  You have to ""unlock"" all special classes in order to use them, even though they were already great and fun to use when you started with them in the first game.  You know the saying--""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

Also, might I add--you cannot see enough on the screen.  The target reticle for EVERY weapon in the game is too big and takes up too much space on the TV screen.

However, there were a few things I did like about the game--the fact that you could play ""Hunt"" mode and use the wampas to kill all the rebels, and the fact that you can be in space battles.  The new classes are pretty cool as well.  These are what probably contributed to enjoyable parts of the game.  Heck, maybe I'll give this game another chance.  But one thing's for sure: it isn't as good as the first one, and it never will be.",Play the first one instead.,1145491200,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},
3.0,False,"02 5, 2008",A3E68QNSCABRVW,B0000640A9,Gradient Vector Field,"I'm a pretty big fan of Role Playing Games, I tend to try and experience all the varieties that are offered, just to at least experience something new and different.  Hunter: The Reckoning is a little different by RPG video game standards, but it's hardly a revolutionary game.  I think this is the first time I've come across a table top RPG converted to video game that did not allow the users to upgrade the characters on their own.  Now, I haven't played the table top game, so I'm not entirely sure how that system worked, but I'm willing to try it out.

On top of this the story line involved demons, and I tend to like things of that ilk, so I thought this might appeal to me.  I must say the story line wasn't as well done as I thought.  It certainly can't compete on the same level as something like Diablo, which is really the premeire game for killing demons in my book!  The background story felt kind of random and thrown together, but the game play and challenge factor kind of saved the game.

The background story basically consists of this: There was apparently an incident at a prison many years ago and your characters were there watching a murderer be executed (no idea why) when all of a sudden people around them turned into monsters.  They faught their way out and boarded up the prison, today they have returned because the ghosts/demons or whatever have returned to feast on the souls and bodies of people throwing a rave in the prison.  Seriously... who throws a rave in a prison?  A fairly loose premise of a video game, but in the end your characters have to lock the spirits back up and save the world!

As a single player game Hunter: The Reckoning sucks and has virtually no value to me, but play it with a few friends and it actually becomes pretty fun.  The game is challenging in some areas and you have to sit down and strategize with your friends.  I don't think this game has endless hours of fun, because after beating it, you're kind of done with it.  The game took only two evenings for my friends and I to conquer, and the shortness is the only reason why a replay is viable.  I would say, in terms of replay value, you can only go through it twice before it gets really boring at the most.  The camera control really does kind of suck, I saw some reviewers touch upon that.  I do realize that as a game designer camera control problems are tantamount in a multi-player overhead RPG.  I really think the programmers could have handled it a lot better and really should've gone in a different direction.

Overall I thought this game was pretty fun, but only when I played it with a few friends.  I gave it a three overall because of some design flaws, the weak storyline, and not being able to level up your character on your own.  Maybe I'm just picky, but I've come to expect a lot more from RPG's thanks to very epic games like Diablo, Knights of the Old Republic, etc.  Pick this up you're looking for a multiplayer game to get together with a few friends and delve into a different world.",Definitely more fun with friends,1202169600,,,

There are better games that I could recommend to someone who is not especially concerned with any of the Megaman series; and yet there are certainly worse games out there. Now I don't mean to sound harsh or overly critical but I AM CONCERNED WITH THE VARIOUS MEGAMAN SERIES and the X series may be my favorite. I've been playing Megaman games since the first one came out in the U.S. back in the late 80's when I was a child. I bought the first X game when I got my first job-a paper route-as a boy in 1993 and I PERSONALLY OWN EVERY GAME IN THE SERIES. I'll probably keep buying them as long as they are made.
My favorite game in the X series is Megaman X4. Back in 1997 when I was 14, I rented it, beat it with both X and Zero, then bought it when I saved up enough money! What I love about the game is that it deals with the issue of reploid-human inequality better than the other games, it is the most mature of the X games with some blood, violence, and mild profanity, and it features dramatic anime scenes. I know the game is not without flaw but it is my favorite for those reasons.
Obviously I waited a long time for the sequel to X4. X5 was not released until 2001! After several years of eager anticipation I expected more than X5 delivered and the series never seemed to get all the way back on track since then. X6 was better than X5, mainly because you weren't FORCED to listen to Alia's lame advice, and X7 is better in some way's than X6. It's nice to see that they're willing to try something new with the new semi-3D format. But although I'm not opposed to a 3D Megaman game I think mabey it should be left to the Legends/Dash series.
In Megaman X8 it would be nice to see a RETURN to the 2D format, anime scenes, a more mature tone-(let's face it, those of us who've been playing since the first X game are not little kids anymore)-and a return to a COHERENT STORYLINE! I'd also like to see an END to introducing irrelevant characters like Axl and an end to Sigma!
I won't even get into how Zero's appearance in X7 contradicts X6. Just PLEASE get the story back on track!

The graphics are top notch, especially when there is weather involved. The models are lifelike though refs are still missing and there is no chain gang. The sideline players don't really move or show emotion either. These are little things but make a difference when looking at the game as a whole. The graphics definitely make you feel you are playing a next gen game.

However, I do not like the running game whatsoever, it is very hard to run as once you make a move for a hole to bust through there are three defenders there to tackle you. If you try to go around someone being blocked, they suddenly come free and tackle you. You need a strong offensive line in this game otherwise your running game will be non-existant. Even the AI of the computer when running isn't that impressive - no big games from any runners, including LT.

The whole madden iq system actually backfires - it is easy  to pass the tests (my iq was at 665) but then you play the first game and the game is a lot harder than the madden test - after my first game my iq dropped to 504 so obviously i wasn't really a 665. The game constantly adapts to you which is fun but at the same time I have played 20 games now and no matter who you face they play at your skill level, meaning you don't blow teams out - my biggest win has been by 4.

Fun game yes, gameplay, while much improved, leaves a lot to be desired. No progression in franchise mode makes pre-season and training activities a moot point. I put Favre on the Jets (he is on the legends roster and can be moved to free agency or you can download the roster update). He is rated 99 and is 25 years old so I can have him for like 15 years lol. I might keep him though because if I draft a QB there is no way for him to get better. If they patch this it would be good but for those who can't go online to play it is not fair.

I myself have not had freezing problems but friends of mine have. I can't comment on them since I have not experienced one - I have a brand new elite xbox which might help, I don't know.

When I saw the Microsoft Store had it on a Black Friday sale for $14.99 I picked it up.  Like many others I believe this game is an initial launch and should have been treated/cost as such.  Think of the Gran Turismo 5 prequel.  It initially cost $40-$50, but they, like Microsoft, soon realized it was not complete and should not cost as such.  Plus GT5 was a complete waste of time. Now Microsoft, Turn10, and Playgound are gouging MS Points and Tokens to expand the game appropriately it comes across as a thinly veiled attempt to obtain more revenue to bring the game up to par.

I have high hopes that over the next few months they will release more locations (which will cost $$) and up to date vehicle packs (again more $$), but for the moment it works very well as a $15 game and with the expanded packs, should they come, it may balance out to a full priced game.

For those who paid full price or worse yet got the Limited Edition I would actually inquire with Microsoft to see if you can be refunded in MS Points or be given some form of credit for helping to establish the Horizon community.  If I paid between $50-$75 for a game and then saw it a month after release at $15 I would be extremely upset.  Horizon has the potential to be a great game, it just needs to grow.  I think Turn 10 and Playground are relying too heavily on there being an always expanding online community.  As we have seen with other driving games this is never the case...See 'Need For Speed Hot Pursuit' for clarification.

While online communities are great, they always fluctuate and there is little incentive to keep going back if your rivals never update and you and your friends move on to other games.  You need to have a solid standalone mode to ask for the kind of money they want for this.  It is not Call of Duty or other FPS games that already have established online systems.

I have not played the previous games in the series but decided to grab this game and give it a try after the price dropped to around 20 bucks.  In some respects, this game reminds me of the GTA series with a mix of a bit of Far Cry.  I am not sure the gameplay is as smooth as the GTA5 or Far Cry, but it is pretty similar in a lot of ways.

For me, I have had a hard time getting use to the button setup as I have been playing the A/C series lately and gotten use to how to run, jump, etcwith those games.  The graphics are well done in this game as is the unique way the backstory is told.  The cut screens tend to be a bit long though and sometimes interrupt the flow of the game.

Initial install and load times tend to be long as well.  I thought I was done with the install after loading the disk only to find that there is more installing to do that takes several minutes after the title screen loads up.  Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying if you are ready to get playing.

Set in the 60s, this has a perfect soundtrack for the time the game is set in and really adds to the atmosphere. The missions are fun but do get repetitive over time.  The map doesnt seem to be packed with side missions or my least favorite thing to do in games, collectables.  The game could be a bit clearer on how it marks the objectives as well.  The game feels less open world and more linear than the GTA series.  The AI doesnt seem as smart as the GTA series.  The driving doesnt seem to be as smooth as GTA either.  No fast travel is a bit of a bummer with games these days as well.

Overall, I feel it is a solid game and worth playing for the 20 to 30 bucks price range but I don't think it matches GTA5 in overall gameplay, vast amount of missions and side quests.  I still find it enjoyable and engaging to play, even if it falls a bit short to what I have come to expect from games such as GTA and FC.

Don't get me wrong--I love Rock Band.  And this is a loving, high-effort tribute.  Still, for full retail it's a little on the short side.  Not being a huge Beatles-catalog fan, there were a good many of the songs I did not recognize.

The game picked up speed when you get back to Abbey Road--and get to play some of their trippy songs with the great visuals.

The whole experience is more 'muted' than you've come to expect--but I think that's fitting and a stylistic choice.

I played all the way through it in one day on Expert, and didn't fail a song--and I'm not that good.  So the difficulty, at least on guitar, is way below that of the GH/RB series.  But again, that's not the point.

3.0,False,"08 1, 2008",ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B000M17AVO,Ron Burgandy,"I'd bought my PS3 about four or five months ago.  I have a pretty nice HDTV and really wanted a Blu-Ray player to compliment it.  It also didn't hurt that I had a bunch of PS2 games I still wanted to play.

After everything was all set up and I started watching a couple of movies, it became apparent extremely quickly that I was going to need a remote for the Blu-Ray features.  Using the controller was just overly complex to make it a real option.

When I finally grabbed a remote, there were a few things I noticed immediately.  Namely, the simple fact that it was a Bluetooth device meant that there was no chance that I was going to be able to use this with any of my other devices like my TV or my surround-sound receiver.  Some people don't really care, but I hate having a thousand remotes lying around.  I'd rather just have one and forget about it.

Considering that the PS3 is the only device that the remote is able to control, I fail to see why it's covered with buttons.  Outside the obvious 'Play/ Pause/ Stop' buttons, I don't understand the decision to make this look so much more complex then it has to be.  I would have tried to make the button layout as simple as possible.  If it's not going to be able to be used for another device, it (at least) could be easy to use.  I would say that two-thirds of the remote's face, you'll never use.

Another reviewer mentioned it, but it bears repeating.  If you touch any button on the device, it'll automatically cue-up your system.  The PS3 is a wonderful piece of equiptment and I like it a lot, but man that sucker kicks out a TON of heat.  Having said that, I do try to make a deliberate effort not to keep it on longer then I have to.  When I'm sitting and watching TV, however, I tend to have both my remotes next to me.  I can't even tell you the number of times I've accidentally leaned a little too much to one side and booted-up the system.  This is complicated by the fact that there's not just a 'power' button anywhere.  I actually have to toss my receiver over to the PS3 device and manually shut the system off.  It sounds like a small deal, but it's REALLY annoying after you do it a few times.

I'm sure this was mentioned several times before, but I sincerely wish that the device was back-lit.  I, like many others, usually watch TV in low-light.  Between the (unnecessarily) complex button configuration and the simple fact that you can't read the thing, it makes simply watching a movie more of a chore then it needs to be.

Not an outright ""bad"" piece and certainly a better option then the controller.  It's also better then any of the third-party devices that I was able to find.  All that having been said, however, I'd still say that Sony's remote wasn't very well thought out either.

3.0,False,"05 8, 2011",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000SKUHKA,JJ,"NOTE - Because Amazon has 2 separate product pages for this game, I am posting the review on both.

I bought ""Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder"" on a whim, not knowing much about it and not expecting much from it. It definitely surprised me with some truly horrifying scenes, which I loved, but it also let me down with a horribly done story in addition to some other issues.

STORY

You take on the character of Detective Howard Loreid who has been assigned the case of tracking down the missing Loath Nolder. Mr. Nolder, who previously had been a detective, went missing five years earlier after being accused of murdering one of his own clients! While searching for Nolder, Howard is plagued with many nightmares, which distort his vision of what is real and what is not. When he starts to encounter terrifyingly weird occurrences during his investigation, he has to determine if he is going mad or if there really is a force working against him.

Although this story can sound incredibly intriguing and fascinating at the beginning, once you actually delve into the plot, which had fantastic potential, everything simply falls apart. There are so many plot lines that spring up, never to be discussed again. Also about halfway through the game, Loath Nolder is never discussed again, making it seem like you're not even looking for him anymore even though searching for him is supposed to be the main quest-it's even in the title of the game! His disappearance, like many other things, is never resolved in the game, and everything was confusing about the story the by the end, nothing made any sense whatsoever. There were so many loose ends and unanswered questions that were simply left untouched by this truly atrocious story.

GAMEPLAY

This game is a first person, point-and-click adventure game with a 360 pan. Now, sometimes 360 panning can completely ruin an adventure game, making it nearly impossible to navigate and pick up inventory items; however, in this game, the panning was a fantastic element that added to the game immensely!

It really wasn't hard to find items at all, with the rare exception of a few items near the end of the game. Another thing that wasn't particularly difficult was the puzzles. They may not be solved right away, but provided you use logic and think about them, they should be very solvable.

I will confess to using a walkthrough near the last third of the game, but this wasn't because the inventory items were particularly hard to find or the puzzles were extremely challenging. I used the walkthrough because there were so many large locations with no real direction as to what you are supposed to do next, and I got a bit overwhelmed, lost, and confused.

There was a hint system in the game that was supposed to help you whenever you were stuck, but it seems that hints have only been programmed to pop up when the developers felt like you might need one. In other words, hints aren't provided throughout the game, only at certain times.

There are three main levels. The easiest has easier puzzles and more hints, the hard has harder puzzles and no hints, while the level in between has hints provided only when you go a certain time without doing the right thing and easy puzzles.

Your inventory interface contains all of the items you've collected in the game (including a cell phone which you rarely use) and a ""brain"" section. In the ""brain"" section, you can combine inventory items or ideas to create new items or ideas.

The horror element of the game was fantastic, I thought! You have the constant feeling that something is going to jump out at you, and unlike many other horror adventure games, things consistently DO jump out at you. You usually lose control of your character before anything spooky happens, but it's creepy nonetheless.

GRAPHICS/SOUND

I thought that the graphics were pretty amazing in this game! The environments may have lacked enough lighting to really see, but then again, that really added to the atmosphere of the game.

The music didn't play constantly, but when it did, it was very creepy in a mourning kind of way, and it also set the atmosphere of the game.

The voice acting was very, very good. There wasn't too much of it throughout the game, but when it was there, I thought it was well done.

OVERALL

The game definitely has a lot of pros, such as the fantastic graphics and sound, above average gameplay, and strong length (which was about 8 hours using a walktrhough for the last third of the game). Unfortunately, the horrid story, overwhelming aspects, and overall confusing nature just took too much away from the game for me.

There is a definite replay value to the game since after you complete it, you are told how many easter eggs, hidden clues, etc. you found. I had found a vast minority, and if I were to replay the game, I would definitely strive for finding the hidden areas. However, because the story made no sense and seems to change throughout the game, I'm not sure I ever will play this game again, and I'm not sure that I could recommend it for others to play.

If you enjoyed Scratches, you may very well enjoy this game; just be forewarned that the plot is absolutely horrible.",Slightly terrifying but the story makes no sense!,1304812800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
3.0,True,"03 23, 2010",A1GCZ07XRJX858,B002GHHJQI,Tanstaafl,"... close wins no awards. This should have been better; much better. There were a few horribly thought out levels and way too many invisible items to find (tap...tap...tap...repeat dozens of times - if it had only been just that frustrating). Details below.

The different levels in this game and its features run from 5 stars down to 1 star - and that's a real shame. At the start, I though this was going to be a winner. Puzzles should cause the player to have to think, but not be so difficult that they are more like work than fun. And by difficult, I'm not talking about solving the problems, but getting the items so you can work on solving the problems.

There are way, way too many places where the only way pieces of the puzzle could be found was by constant tapping until you hit something. The little glimmering ""hint"" feature is of little use. The biggest problem with finding things that were so well hidden is that you had to hit within a hair of the item. This meant having to saturate the area with taps - but just a hair to close to one another and the description screen would pop up that you then had to click again to get rid of. This was altogether very frustrating - again all in an attempt to find invisible items. Moving the small items around, as you are required to do many times, is equally as frustrating. You have to try multiple times to pick up the item you want to use and multiple times more to drop it where you want it.

The requirement to click within such a fine tolerance made some levels horrible to get through. That feature ruined the enjoyment of what should have been fun puzzles.

The graphics are very good, the music is better than average, the overall game design is fun to play. The details are just too frustrating and uneven. This was so close to being a 5 star game. The poor features are so annoying, though, that the entire game gets dragged down.

For anyone without a music background: Minor spoiler alert! Level 9 - the Piano Room. There are a couple of puzzles here and a whole world of frustration. First there is a lot of blind tapping to find a few of the items. Then, and this is a 1 star feature of this game, if you do not have an ear for music - quit right here. You have to listen to tunes, convert them to notes, memorize them, and go to a piano to play the notes - 7 times! EDIT 3/31/10 I have been told that in Level 9, you can turn the crank and watch to learn tune to enter. End of 3/31/10 edit. I am not musically inclined. I personally think there should be a kazoo section in a symphony orchestra (where's Spike Jones when we need him?). It was only by use of the faq by CasaNova73099 I found on gamefaqs that I was able go get through this level. End of spoiler.

That level 9 fiasco would have caused me to return the game had someone not posted some help (which should not be required for a game of this level of play!). Level 16 is also ruined by the invisible item problem. It has some of the best puzzles in the game, but the frustration of finding dark pieces in the dark is something that removed the enjoyment. Such design features are a sign of lazy design not cleverness of puzzle construction.

Before you work on a new game, Zoo, you should fix this one. The caveat in your manual that items may be small and hard to find does not equate with so small that you can only find them by constant tapping. Do you not have gamers from your target market test these before you release them? If not, why not?

Overall: There is a fun game in here, marred by releasing it without really testing it for playability.

Get it: if you don't mind tapping your way through level after level - and multi-tapping when there should be no need due to the stylus controls being so fine tuned as to be hard to use for small items.

Get it: if you have no problems with music or don't mind having to use someone else's notes to get through a level or two.

Don't get it: if you want a relaxing puzzle game that relies on brain work more than luck at finding stuff. There are some very fun puzzles, but not nearly as fun as they should have been.","Close to being very, very good. But...",1269302400,61,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo DS'},

At the time this game came out, it was pretty good because there wasn't much of a selection for Playstation RPGs. But by now, there are much better games out there.
The story line is based on the usual ""Young boy goes off on an advneture to save the world."" Most of it has been done before. The magic is pretty good. Most of the spells are fairly original, and the graphics that go along with them aren't too bad considering the cartoon appearence of the rest of the game.
I remember being a little annoyed by the excessive random encounters in some of the dungeons, but it's nothing I haven't dealt with before. One dungeon that stands out in my mind however comes near the end of the game, and it was by far the most nervewrackingly annoying dungeon I have ever encountered in ANY RPG (and I've played them all!). There are invisible pit traps all throughout the already long dungeon, which drop you down to the previous floor somewhere, which also has pits...

1- the game graphics is great its look very nice.
2- the game movement is nice and easy and flexible.

these two point what i liked.

as what i didn't like in the game:

1- story mode is short and don't have a strong script , i think this is a problem with MK in last few releases.
2- the characters variates are good but to be honest as MKX Title and first version on new Gen i thought we will had variates of charterers as MK Ultimate edition at least.
3- fatalities , brutalities are nice but they are exposed before the game release we knew all fatalities and brutalities before we bought the game i remember in the old releases once we play the game and try the fatalities for the first time we where excited what will happen now we knew everything before we try it there is no fun to do it.
4- the krypt concept is nice once it was first appear in MK games , but we usually we play the krypt to unlock new playable characters as a great reward , this one don't have special unlock able rewards in my opinion.
5- i had the game on it release date and to be honest i get board after 3 days there is nothing special you can play if you play it solo with no friends.

in the end am MK fan but in this release the marketing for the game showed every tiny thing in the game before you buy it which killed the game to be honest when i was seeing the trailers the gameplay the fatalities ..etc i thought there will be a ton of features , characters , moves , rewards but it appeared that they show it all.

This highly memorable game with its cheesy dialogue and memorable puzzles (moonlight sonata anyone?) was a first for nearly everyone who played it.  Worth playing to this very day but if your not a fan of playstation 1 graphics (they are dated) may wish to grab ps3 or other updated version which are also well liked.

Resident Evil 2:The highlight of the entire survival horror genre in many people's opinions.  Bringing the genre to it's peak with it's entertaining story and game play, game makers must of started to feel pressure to change up the formula rather trying to top this gaming masterpeiece. Yea some might laugh at me calling this a masterpeice but to those people i say it is a masterpeice of cheesy lines and entertaining gameplay and story with cheap thrills and scares along the way.

Resident Evil 3: This one is seen in two very opposing lights.  On one side some people think of this as the best resident evil game it had the most thrills and chills something around every corner however this is clearly where resident evil started to turn away from it's genre
this is the start resident evil turning into a action oriented game. In the view of some people leading to the downfall of the series a few years down the road to others a rebirth. To me personally it's a little of both.  It's a good game nonetheless i enjoyed the mini game at the end more than the actually story mode.

Code Veronica: This was a good game what makes or breaks this game for fans who already played the previous entries is the story.  Many found this game to be the pinnacle of Survival Horror with it the game makers balancing the gameplay better than they did in RE3 as well as improving the graphics backgrounds now rendered in full 3d. I personally didn't like the story so overall i found it to be an underwhelming game but gameplay wise it was certainly was top notch with well balanced gameplay.  Developers consider this to be a direct sequel to RE2.

Resident Evil Zero: Zero is a good game but one plagued with problems from having to backtrack far to often to tedius item swapping to boring puzzles but some of us still forgive it because it's unique and classic style RE and for giving us some background story for the orignal RE.

Resident Evil Outbreak & File #2: An average RE game with the ability to play with 3 other people online so really it was just an RE Social Experiment but a decent game nonetheless and you can play it single player if you wish to.

Resident Evil 4: Made a full transition from survival horror to an plain ole action game barely maintaining any Horror elements at all and attempting to hold onto it's survival elements and enhance them.  Opinions vary wildly on this one
personally RE2 and 4 are my absolute favorites even so RE4 isn't really survival horror it's a great game nonetheless but you can see why long time fans would be dissapointed they expected surviaval horror and they didn't get it.

Resident Evil 5: To some the last great resident evil game to others the series end of relevance...  Tries to up the Survival elements even more swarming you with seemingly endless enemies forcing you to learn your enviroments and know when to run and when to fight which completly changes the gameplay and has little to nothing in common with the rest of the franchise.  This games highlight by most accounts is the multiplayer you can play 2 player story mode.  This in my opinion is RE dumbed down for the masses to enjoy if you can... mindless fun killing of the ""undead"". Fun for what it is i suppose.

Resident Evil Mercenaries 3D/VS:  3d is basically the Mercenaries Mode from RE4 updated and with new scenarios and characters from RE5.  It's fun especially if your a huge fan of RE4 but i wouldn't call it essential by any means.  Game recieved mixed reviews basically if you want more RE4 get it if not forget it.  Vs most would agree just forget it but if you have an iphone or ipad and you love RE4 and wish it had multiplayer online VS mode then hey give it a shot maybe you be one of the few who enjoy it.

Resident Evil 6: Resident evil 6 tries to reinvent resident evil again an obvious attempt to renew the franchise however it fails in most fans opinions.  The game takes a more cinematic approach the graphics are seriously impressive but where it suffers is gameplay the gameplay isn't as fun as in previously installments in most people's opinions and the game reviews reflect that with lower scores.  An above average game but RE fans will be potentially turned off by the fact that this game doesn't resemble RE's past games at all. Also has co-op campaign.

Revelations:  Capcom's response to the negative feedback RE6 got.  Revelations attempts to take the best of elements of classic RE and combine them with new RE.  An episodic adventure that regains alot of the feeling of RE series.  This brings the series back nearly as good as classics RE1 - Code Veronica as close we can hope for in this day and age.  No co-op campaign this time around but a multiplayer raid mode instead.

Revelations 2:Different Story line same idea as revelations but this time they brought co-op campaign mode back but only in split screen (no online).  Raid Mode is online only so guess you and your friend better like this mode if multiplayer is your thing.
This game is nearly as good as the first and some of its extras are superior to the first one.

Footnote Resident Evil Gun/Survivor Spin Offs:  The Umbrella Chronicles & The Darkside Chronicles were both solid rail shooter games that re-tells parts of resident evil story line solid entertainment and a must have if your a fan of both rail shooters and RE if not check out if your interested.  The Survivor Games are a crapfest if you check them out you have been warned best for die hards who like the amusement of really bad games.

SUMMARY: If you never played Resident Evil 2 and can look past the dated graphics get it asap. If you can't look past the dated graphics wait for the remake or grab Code Veronica Instead.  If you like Action Shooter type games Get Resident Evil 4 asap its been re-released on PS4 and most other home consoles.  If you want multiplayer consider RE5 for its co-op campaign or Revelations 2.  If you just want a game closer to the feeling of classic RE with multiplayer options Revlations or Revelations 2 are good options.  If you ever thought what would happen if they made RE almost B movie like ... try RE6 lol",Resident Evil Series Review,1471737600,2,,

3.0,False,"02 12, 2013",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B0050SYUSU,JJ,"The cover of ""Rabbids: Alive and Kicking"" just hints at the quirkiness that is contained in this game. Nearly everything you will be required to do while playing involves embarrassing or ridiculous movements. The entire game creates an atmosphere that will allow you and your friends to have a ridiculously good time for a few hours; although, most likely, you will be bored with this game by the end of the night.

""Rabbids: Alive and Kicking"" is composed of various minigames that you undertake in the attempt to stop the rabbids from taking over your city. There's no real story other than the idea of this Rabbid invasion.

The minigames vary in length, style, and exertion. Some games will be done in ten seconds, while other games may take you five minutes to complete. In addition, the games may be specifically multiplayer or solo; they also may require you to do an action vocally as opposed to physically. An example would be a certain game that requires you to yell at rabbids and scare them away. It can be difficult to complete some such games if you're playing at night while others are sleeping nearby or in a location where yelling is not conducive. Also, some of the games will require you to run as quickly as possible or swing your arms in a rigorous swimming motion while other games will just ask you to wave your hand or stick out your tongue. It was often underwhelming to go from a high-adrenaline game to one where you mostly just stand there for a few minutes.

Overall, some of the games were winners while others were boring duds. There's enough variety for everyone to find something he or she likes, but since most of the games are ridiculously silly, they will probably be enjoyed most by children and people who host game night parties. Even then, the games aren't engaging enough to keep excitement up for very long. The boring factor sets in pretty quickly.

Space is definitely something you need for this game. With some Kinect titles, you can get away with just using a small square on your floor; but in this game, you will need a huge amount of area so that you can move side to side, kick, and run around.

The loading screens are the biggest pain! They take a significant amount of time, and when you're playing one of the quick 10 second games, the loading screens will take the short experience and force to take about a full minute. After every game, there's a loading screen; after every menu selection, there's a loading screen. It gets annoying and detracts from the fun.

The actual menu setup is fine and easy to navigate through.  I rarely found myself incorrectly selecting things.

There is a reward system in place that awards rolls of toilet paper for doing well in games. I haven't found anything to do with the toilet paper, so it seems to be just a point system of sorts that really doesn't serve much purpose other than setting records.

Graphically, the game is pretty darn good. The areas are vibrant, cartoony, and give a happy atmosphere that almost makes you want to jump in and start playing. The music is also very happy, but it tends to be forgettable and doesn't add much to the game.

It's difficult to say definitely whether or not YOU personally will like this game. I'm a silly person; I love playing ridiculous games, but this just bored me after playing it for a while. I tried playing it with some friends who also enjoy silly games, and although some of them got into the minigames for a bit, others didn't find the game appealing at all. The menu loading is obnoxious, but the graphics are lovely. The gameplay is OK, and the music is bland. This is a game I'd recommend trying the demo for or looking up some gameplay on YouTube before deciding to buy it.

The game has potential and will most likely be more fun for kids, but I honestly didn't find it much better than a short distraction that was fun while it lasted.",Ridiculously fun but becomes boring,1360627200,,,

3.0,False,"09 15, 2011",A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000ME07W0,A. Griffiths,"I'm working my way through all the PS3 RPGs and it's taken me a while to get to this one as it's never really stood out in reviews plus it's also not for sale in a lot of stores but I have finally caught up. Most reviewers are accurate however, because it is not remarkable in any way, however it is a solid game that works and is fairly fun to play.

So, as befits a Japanese-style RPG this adventure sees you take on the role of a feisty, spiky haired teenager who is going about his business when a terrible and mighty power threatens the world. Unbeknown to you, you have a secret hidden power, which means that you alone are capable of fighting the menace that threatens life as we know it. Together with a rag bag assortment of team mates that include a high born female character with healing powers, a hulk of a brute palace guard with strong physical skills and a perky comedy sidekick who has skill with guns, you make your way through various dungeons and settlements to eventually meet up with and wipeout the terror for good.

I swear in my reviews I could have copied that last paragraph and pasted it every time I review one of these games...it's unbelievable that RPGs are STILL slavishly following this formula after so many years. But there you go. Nuff said.

So, onto battles. Turn based, random encounters. Nothing new there. But there are some clever touches. First of all, battles take place on a grid, and part of your turn involves moving to a square on the grid before attacking. The reason for this is that each character has attack moves that hit a selected range, sometimes this is a strict line in front of them, sometimes a fan out or a single square directly in front of them. So you can see that the ""move"" step gives depth to the fighting because you need to make sure each character moves to a square where an enemy is with their range to hit...hopefully more than one at a  time. After moving you choose your attack move, then repeat for all characters, and then once they are all set, the attacks all play out, and the enemy takes their turn.

The reason I liked this is because of the additional strategy. Because, all of the following can happen and affect the flow of battle:
1. The enemy also has set attack ranges so you should also take care not to bunch up so all your team are in range of too many attacks.
2. Characters and enemies have elemental classes that do double or half damage for opposing or same element attacks.
3. Putting character behind other characters gives the ones at the back ""cover"" and reduced damage from some attacks
4. Some enemies also do this, often a weak boss is behind a clump of big fat tank supporting enemies that cover him.
5. Sometimes you get combos if several characters target the same enemy, the attacks stack together ( a combo meter has to fill for this)
6. Enemies can also get combos on you - this can be devastating
7. Characters have a ""limit-break"" attack called an EX move that can only be used sparingly - save this for bosses. EX moves are also elemental.

So as you can see the battles can be fun. What lets them down is minor, but the camera view for battles is dreadful, it has about 4 fixed view points, none of which let you see every part of the battle grid clearly - and you need this to plan your positioning. Which is the shame as normal gameplay has a very good player-controlled camera view. But apart from that I enjoyed all the fights. You get better experience for better fights (for example, winning with ""overkill"" moves rather than just scraping a victory by attrition earns you more points) so it pays to fight smart.

But now I'm afraid I have to list a few things that don't score so well with this game. The environments and scenery are not that good. Some places like the towns have quite poor textures on the buildings and are low on detail. All the NPCs are built using the same basic models (about 6 of them) just with different clothes. The external scenery is also quite drab - trees have few branches and sometimes just sprout from the ground like posts with no effort made to create realistic roots or foundations (the area outside the Earth Temple was particularly bad). Sense of height and distance is good, you can be quite high up (in London city for example) and enjoy some nice views, but on the whole the environments are not that impressive. Watch out for the stage set in Kyoto where there is an appallingly bad attempt at showing reflections in water which really should have been fixed before release. The other niggle is that nearly all the cut scenes are done via static portraits of the characters with recorded speech and subtitles. So an anguished confession or heated argument will sound great on the soundtrack (the voice recordings are quite good), but might be played out over a 2D image of the character set in position with a hand over their face.

My other drawback is the golem collection aspect of the game: as you progress you can find and create ""golems"" which can be used in your team. There are supposedly up to 140 different golems that can be found created or won in the game. It's very reminiscent of the Shin Megami Tensiei series of game, in that you find creatures and use them in your battle team, and the further into the game you go, the better the golems. Each golem has a unique design, character and skills. This sounds like fun, but my issue is this: once you have met the four main human characters in the game, you have no more rom in your battle team for any golems. The four human characters have very flexible skills and abilities - the golems do not. They never learn new skills., but the human characters keep evolving. So as soon as I had my main four, I hardly ever used golems in battle again, and I even stopped synthesising the ones that I had found as they all just got stuck in my inventory and did nothing.

Apart from those niggles, I did enjoy the game. It's relatively easy if you level up properly although there are some tricky bosses . There are optional bosses and an optional dungeon, a casino/battle arena where you can play for fun, and some ultimate weapons and skills to earn. All standard fare for an RPG and all fairly satisfactory.",Ok but not fantastic,1316044800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I've played both the Sims & The Sims 2 games with expansions and really enjoyed all of them. My issues were always that the the First series of The Sims, even though rough had many different things to do. Your Sim went to the movie set, and worked. They went to the amusement park and went on rides. The vacations and the beach had add ons with the hotels an were fun. Even the games for Playstation 2 etc., you have motorcyles and bicycles and subways/subway stations etc. It would be cool if the Sims 2 or even The Sims 3 had work  and school
interactions. Have a boss or co worker that ticks the sim off and instead of sending a messege at home that ""your boss wants you to do something and make a choice, actuakky have the boss assign work etc and show what happens if your sims makes a bad or good choice. At a school get bullied by a dopey bully on the school yard, actually have interaction with a teacher when the grades go down etc. College would be more interactive in classes and the final exam. Have a running hospital, where the ambulance gets your sick or pregnant sim from their home, takes them to the hospital & what happens happens but there is interaction. Actually take your toddler to the park or restuarant (with high chair included in restuarant to add to table) and let them interact instead of leaving them home.

3.0,True,"11 21, 2010",A127AQ1AD4SRV4,B000M17AVO,E. Ziegler,"I originally bought this remote because I was too lazy to learn how to navigate with the regular controller.  I got tired of having to wait from ""wake up"" the PS3 controller to pause my movie or to resume.  I gave this device 3 stars because it does what it was designed to do, it lacked features that you would find on a standard remote, and it's poor design.  I'll start with all the bad stuff since that what you want to know about the product before you buy it.

Well the biggest reason people buy this is to have a device that makes watching/navigating a movie easier.  Most people watch movies in the dark so having button that would light up or glow would of helped.  Most of the better manufactured remotes come with this feature.

Like most other people complained, this stop button will take you back to the PS3 screen instead of just stopping the movie and going back to the main menu.  Certain movies have a auto-resume feature that will let you jump back at the same spot. So if the movie you are watching doesn't have that feature, it becomes very inconvenient to have to so search for your spot.  I also don't know why they didn't combined the pause and play button.

Many people complained that pressing any button will turn on your PS3.  What most people don't realize it's because of the bluetooth, which was a very poor implementation for a remote.  Bluetooth was meant to be used for devices transferring low data rates and security.  The PS3 is actually in a standby mode than turned off.  When it is in standby, the bluetooth is still active and when it recognizes a command, it will wake the PS3 up to receive commands. A feature of bluetooth is to shut off after a period of time of inactivity to save power.  This is why some people complain about having to press a button twice.  First press ""wake"" it up and the second one executes the function of their choice.  After saying all that, it still sucks that you turn on your PS3 every time a button is accidentally pressed.  The only advantage to having bluetooth is that you don't have to point it at the PS3 to use it.

If you rub you finger or thumb lightly over any of the lettering on the remote, you can feel the texture of the letters.  If you can feel the lettering that easy, that means the manufacture printed the lettering on top without any type of coating.  What does this mean? It means that after a good amount of use, the lettering will rub off and you will have to know what the button does.

This probably doesn't affect most people, but if you have an older PS3, you might have to update your firmware before it works.  You have to have firmware v1.30 or higher to use the remote.

Sony has been in the business of making electronic devices and this definitely did not show any ingenuity for a device that you can only use on your PS3.  With the exception of the analog sticks, the remote has every button you can press on the PS3 controller in the center of the remote.  I guess you can look at it like an oversize PS3 controller.  Overall if you are wanting a remote to watch your movies instead of using your controller and you don't mind spending roughly $20, then this would benefit you.  If you don't mind using the PS3 controller for all your needs, then you can definitely pass this up.  I don't know of any blu-rays that require this remote to access certain features.",Nice PS3 accessory if it was designed better,1290297600,4,,

I like that, having not played Street Fighter in a fairly long time, it was easy to pick up and get back into it.  There are a lot of classic characters (Chun-Li, E. Honda, Guile, Ken, Ryu and more) and enough new guys to make it interesting.

The game is visually great.  Maybe not as knockout gorgeous as Soul Calibur, but these characters are more cartoony and fluid.  Watching Dalsim or Rufus are perfect examples of this cartoony/rubber element.  The stylized impact animations add a nice graphic touch.  The character ""movies"" that try and tell something of a story are in general cheap basic anime style.  Some fans of the Street Fighter series and anime may enjoy it, but I had to roll my eyes at it.  The music is very J-pop, not a plus for me.

However, those of you who are looking for a classic update are in for a surprise.  The challenge of even the computer controlled opponents is much higher.  This is probably due to the better AI capable of modern consoles, but it is also because the control/fighting system has changed.  Its not apparent at first, but there are counters, super combos, ""revege"" combos and a lot of other interesting features just underneath the classic six-button controls you're so used to.
You really should spend some time ""sparring"" with a friend before you even think about playing against random online opponents and in general, you'll have your work cut out for you against the computer even on the medium setting.

I strongly encourage people to rent this game before they buy it (or perhaps download SFIIturboHDremix on Xbox Live).  Its a great game, and I think if you have a group of fighter friends (I don't, sadly) you'll get some great mileage out of this.  In addition, I would look into buying an arcade style controller, because I think some of the combos and moves are little hard to execute with the xbox controller (primarily regarding stick directions).

They strayed from the formula, and in my opinion, failed. If it wasn't a Final Fantasy, it may've been an acceptable game. But the fact that they try to make these moves on a basic installment, just pisses me off.
Pros: The characters are all interesting and diverse. The weapons and higher-level spells and abilities are neat. The worlds are beautiful. The story is fascinating and keeps you guessing, even if sometimes you have no idea what the hell is going on.
Cons: In many places, the music sounds like it belongs on an elevator in the Mall of America, however the battle scenes are some of the best in the series, such as the battles with Barthandelus. You only control the actions of the main character, and the AI for your party members is sometimes retarded. The paradigms are too simple; I finished the game using three paradigms with the same three characters, with ease. You end up doing the same commands over and over, as the battle moves so quick, that you'll be useless if you go through selecting different skills and whatnot. The strategy aspect is almost non-existent. It is ridiculously linear, even moreso than FFX was.

3.0,False,"10 2, 2003",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00005BRKQ,TwistaG,"THQ's Sega Arcade Gallery brings together four classic arcade games on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge. The collection includes Space Harrier, OutRun, Super Hang-On, and After Burner, all of which were originally released between 1985 and 1987. For the most part, the games come across well on the Game Boy Advance. All four employ traditional two-dimensional sprite-based graphics and use basric scaling and rotation effects to suggest the appearance of three-dimensional environments--a technique that's perfectly suited to the capabilities of Nintendo's popular handheld. While these games would seem dated on a more powerful console, they fit right in on the GBA.
Even today, OutRun is a truly enjoyable racing game. Space Harrier is the oldest game in the compilation, and it's also the most unique. Set in a world known as the fantasy zone, the game puts you in control of a warrior who soars through the air on a jetpack and battles monstrous creatures using a powerful blaster rifle. Thanks to the forward thrust produced by the jetpack, enemies and terrain are constantly racing toward you. It's your job to dodge these hazards and use your blaster rifle to defeat the bosses waiting at the end of each stage.
Space Harrier was just the second project for a 27-year-old producer and programmer named Yu Suzuki, who would later go on to design many recent hits such as Virtua Fighter 4, F355 Challenge, and Shenmue. Bits Studios did a nice job of bringing Suzuki's second undertaking to the GBA. The psychedelic color schemes and fast shooting action are just as addictive on the smaller screen. The only major deviation from the arcade game is the removal of the specific theme music for each of the bosses. Eagle-eyed fans of the original will also notice that the enemies don't aim as accurately in the GBA version, but the game is still plenty challenging. The next game in the collection is OutRun, which places you behind the wheel of a snazzy red sports car. Your goal is to beat the clock while traveling from one course segment to the next. Although there aren't any opponents to speak of, commuter traffic can slow you down or nudge you off the highway--where a collision with the various signs and boulders along the roadside will lead to a time-consuming rollover accident. A gearshift toggle lets you select between high and low gears, giving you better control through hairpin turns. The most distinctive feature of OutRun is that it allows you to choose between two different pathways at the end of each course segment. In this fashion, the scenery changes with each successive segment, giving you control over how the environment looks every time you play the game. In total, the game contains 15 unique courses. Except for a few minor differences, the version of OutRun included in this compilation is a tiny doppelganger of the original arcade game. The most noteworthy change involves the tendency of the car to pull more quickly toward the side of the road at higher speeds. This is a difference some purists may scoff at, but it literally takes less than 30 seconds to adjust to. Devoted fans often point to the game's music as its most outstanding aspect, and the GBA duplicates all three music selections with remarkable accuracy, even if the bass volume seems a little loud at times. Cosmetically speaking, there are fewer boulders and signs lining the side of the road, and the signs announcing the names of upcoming course segments are absent. All the other graphical features from the arcade game are present, however. Super Hang-On, the third game on the cartridge, has a lot in common with OutRun. The underlying goal of both games is the same: to reach the end of a lengthy course as quickly as possible. Here, though, all the vehicles are motorcycles as opposed to cars and trucks. There are a few other differences as well. The gearshift has been replaced with a nitrous boost that you can trigger at top speed, and you no longer have the option to pick and choose course segments during a race. Instead, you choose one of four different premade route maps before the race begins. In all, the game contains a grand total of 48 different course segments. Those of you who remember Super Hang-On for the Sega Genesis may be disappointed to learn that the GBA version doesn't allow you to collect parts or hire different mechanics. Those features were unique to the Sega Genesis version and not included in the original arcade game, which the GBA conversion is based on. Rounding out the collection is After Burner, an aircraft-based shooter in which you have to work your way through roughly 20 stages of oncoming fighter planes. Even though this pint-sized conversion of After Burner looks and sounds like the original arcade game, it doesn't play nearly as well. The controls are slow to respond, and you can avoid most--if not all--incoming fire by performing barrel rolls. The game is also just flat-out missing a few major aspects from the original arcade version, such as the ability to attack ground targets during bonus stages or the need to escape chase planes using the onscreen radar.
This version of After Burner is missing a few aspects from the original arcade game, such as the ability to hit ground targets in the bonus stages. The only other low point for the compilation is the absence of a save feature for recording high scores or pausing games in progress. This isn't a huge complaint by any means, but it's still annoying to make progress in a game or to input your name onto the high score list and have all your hard work disappear once you turn the system off. Despite the omissions and deficiencies in After Burner and the unfortunate absence of a save feature, Sega Arcade Gallery is one retro collection that's worth owning. The ports of Space Harrier, OutRun, and Super Hang-On are remarkably close to the original arcade versions, and all the games in the compilation compare well with what's already available for the Game Boy Advance.","Good,but not great",1065052800,5,,
3.0,True,"05 13, 2011",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B0047TLIBU,Adrian Jenkins,"...but ultimately satisfying as hell. I backed away from this game after a string of reviews comparing it unfavorably to Dragon Age: Origins. That's what I get for listening to the fanboys. Dragon Age II is an incredibly fun romp through the life of Garrett Hawke, as he rises from poverty in a new land to the height of power, but has to deal with so many costs along the way. I can't really say more - spoiling this story would be a shame (and it is a hell of a story). So, let me begin with

THE GOOD:

1) Character interactions. RPGs aren't about stupid battle tactics, or graphics. A role-playing game is about...playing a role. And the role of Garrett Hawke is one heck of a role. The developers have done an outstanding job of creating a character that you can really get behind. I was concerned about the addition of voice in the main character. As it turns out, I should not have been. Be a wise-cracking rogue. Be a stalwart hero. Be a dour mage. Mix it up. The game adapts to your choices, and enhances the experience. Choose a smart-aleck comment long enough, and the game will make you a smart-aleck in cut scenes. People will react to you differently, and will know when you act out of character. It's an incredible accomplishment, and honestly, this is the best it's ever been done (on a console, at least).

Add to this fantastic writing for the other characters, and you and your merry men (and women) will have a great time. Isabella cracks me up every time she speaks. I would put certain characters together to see how they would converse among themselves. At times, I would actually STOP TRAVELING to hear the banter. Aveline and Isabella have great exchanges. In fact, ANYONE and Isabella have great exchanges. But other character interactions are good as well. Put Anders and Merrill together, and hear their varying views on magic. Put Fenris and Varric together, and listen to the dwarf get under the goth elf's skin. In short, I can't believe that ANYONE would complain that the characters were bland. This is 1000x better than the tired interactions in Dragon Age: Origins.

2) Main character development. Hawke is immensely customizable, with numerous armor and weapon options, most of which impact the appearance of the character. The ability trees are great. You won't get close to maxing out all of the available trees, so choices are relevant here. I personally played as a rogue who depended on stealth and backstab. Others might like bows. Or dual weapon. This is only for ONE class, mind you. You can also play as a warrior or a mage, with many other customizations. All in all, the main character is vastly more interesting here (perhaps because there is only one, as opposed to the 6 in DA:O).

3) Combat. Combat has taken a beating from many reviewers. It's completely unfair. The idea that combat is no longer tactical is outrageous. Just go toe-to-toe against the high dragon without thinking through your character choices and your tactics. You'll get your lungs handed to you, even on Casual difficulty.

I'm a button presser. I like pressing buttons. I pressed them constantly in DA:O, despite the fact that they didn't really do anything. Why wouldn't I enjoy actually having the attack button attack, each time I press it? What a concept.

4) The story. Although the tale is a bit open-ended, the story in this game is excellent. There are great plot turns at every point. I can respect that some people found things a little too episodic, but I actually cared to see how Hawke would end up, or how players from previous tales would affect the storyline. And who in the world would have known that Anders would be an incredibly compelling character? I won't spoil any points, but suffice to say, this is a game that I am playing for a second time, immediately after finishing the first playthrough. That's the highest praise I can give story.

THE BAD:

1) Dearth of locales. OK, Bioware. You make this great main character, and put him into this exciting story. Why then can't you be bothered to make more environments? It's embarrassing that EVERY PERSON IN KIRKWALL LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE. They even have the same paintings on the wall, and in storage. Orlesian nobles apparently have the same taste as Orzammar dwarves. Who knew?

The fact is, this is unacceptable. You will travel through the same caves, the same open passages, for the ENTIRE GAME. Was it really that hard to create a different non-descript house? There's only one city in the game. You could at least make it more interesting.

2) Open-endedness of story. OK - I really liked the story. Why not resolve it? We've already seen Bioware fail miserably to resolve open plot lines in the past (see ""Wtich Hunt,"" the single worst DLC I've seen for any game, ever). I can respect that the face of Thedas is changed by the actions of our heroes, and it probably is impossible to resolve this a few cutscenes. Could we at least see how the face of Kirkwall was changed? Or could we see how our heroes fare after the game? Even a little bit? The disappointing end sours an otherwise-great tale.

3) Armor for supporting characters. There is a ton of armor in the game, each with different purpose. What a shame that supporting characters CAN'T EQUIP ANY OF IT. Seriously, you will find hundreds of different pieces of armor throughout the tale (I saved every one of them). The majority of it goes to waste completely. Each supporting character has his or her own armor, which can be (slightly) customized, but cannot be changed. Thus, this leaves Hawke to use every single piece of armor you pick up during the game. Many of the pieces can't even be used, since they are only for specific character classes. What's the point, then?

THE UNFORGIVEABLE:

1) Glitches. Oh, right, Bioware made this. Of COURSE it doesn't work. The game froze up within 5 minutes of me starting it. It proceeded to freeze at least a dozen more times as I played through it. Patches cure some ills, but cause others. Many questlines glitched on me (e.g. I saw the end of Merrill's character quest before I had actually done anything, which spoiled a lot). Some glitches are hilarious (I ""completed"" one quest 6 times before it finally registered as complete, by simply giving an item to a person over and over). Some are frustrating (wow - I was really annoyed when I didn't get my ""SUupplier"" trophy because of - you guessed it - a glitch). None are acceptable. I don't know what's wrong with this company, but this is the kind of crap that people care about in the long term. I would give an impassioned plea for more QC, but what's the point? It's clear that Bioware doesn't care. They are bad enough to drop the game two stars.

But anyway, that's it. If you can put aside the glitches and your own (often irrational) love for the original, you will find an immensely entertaining sequel.","Immensely entertaining, immensely flawed...",1305244800,5,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Voice acting is done by the actors who play the characters in the movie, which adds a lot to the feeling. In addition, characters are modeled on the actors, which adds a lot as well. The game itself does not take too long to play, though going for 100% (I didn't) adds considerable time. Most of the side quests are quick, though I recommend having a walk-through that shows what spells should be cast on what items. The spells themselves are not that difficult once you practice with them. (The motions for the dueling spells are the same as for the non-combat spells, so there aren't too many motions to learn.)

And now to the bad... The player has almost no control of the camera, and the game's camera controls are pretty bad. It isn't uncommon to lose Harry, Hermione, and Ron behind scenery and have to run around until the camera adjusts enough to see them. Controls for the gobstones mini-game are horrible, as there is not fine control of the flicks. (I highly recommend using a free Web-based chess site, like [...], in order to beat the 3 chess champions.) Targeting items and people with spells can be difficult is Harry is standing too close or too far away from the item. In addition, unless you have a walk-through, determining which spells to use when is largely a case of hit or miss. (Some, like broken items or torches, are obvious. Others are not.) A lot of time is spent running from place to place, though if the player set out to get all the secret passage passwords first thing, that would help some. Going from place to place can be tricky, as Hogwarts students stroll around and often get in the way of the party. It is possible to push through them, but it slows the game down. Meanwhile, unnamed Slytherins constantly call out snide comments like ""Been in the Prophet lately, Potter?"" or ""Weasley is our King."" The same phrases got old very fast.

The worst part of the game is the ending. Almost the entire part at the Department of Mysteries is done as cutscenes. The one part the player has control of, Dumbledore's fight with Voldemort, turns into the player waiting for V to power up, then casting a defensive spell to dodge V's power shot, then sitting around waiting again. It took at least 5 deflected shots (done correctly) before that part of the fight ended and the next began - which was just more casting protective magic to dodge V's attacks. Meanwhile, V and D are repeating the same lines over and over, which got very repetitive.

While I must say there were enough unique elements in this game to hold my interest, I couldn't help getting the feeling I was playing just another Grand Theft Auto. Sure, everything had a Scarface theme to it, but when you get right down to it the bulk of the game was running/driving around town completing various missions to unlock additional areas to explore in exactly the same fashion of good ol' GTA.

Construction-wise, this is a well-made keyboard that will hold up over time. I have no complaints about the construction. This is advertised as a ""gaming"" keyboard but doesn't have the normal customization features one would expect. Other gaming keyboards I own, for example, allow you to set the backlight specifically on core keys, like highlighting the WASD keys for movement or just highlighting the F1, F2, etc keys for hotkey use. The only customization is changing the entire backlight color and presentation, so you can have a solid one color or multi-color or a wave effect.

The raised keys and spacing reduce mistypes and slips, which is important when you type as fast as I do. If you are someone who uses the ""hunt and peck"" typing technique, you may have a problem with this keyboard. There is very little contrast between the numbers and the keys, and the lack of contrast is compounded when you have one of the neon colors activated. I have a black mechanical keyboard at home with red backlights that offers exceptional contrast. But the contrast on this white keyboard with the neon colors actually makes it hard to see the keys if you need to search for them. It also doesn't help that the keyboard uses a sci-fi style font choice where the letters and numbers have broken lines in odd places. For example, ""B"" has breaks at the top and bottom that make the key look like a cross between an H and a 3. The number ""8"" key actually looks like a capital ""H."" And the ""0"" key looks like ( ). If you are a skilled typist, this won't matter because you don't look at the keys anyway.

Without a doubt, Halo 1 & 2 have the most engrossing story and universe compared to any other game bar none. Better than average AI and a decent assortment of weapons can easily keep one entertained. In fact, there is not a lot negative to say about Halo, but one of the problems is bad enough to bring down the entire game. This is of course, the use of checkpoint saves as opposed to user saves. It may seem like a long game to some of the less perceptive gamers, but in reality a lot of the game is simply doing the same exact things over and over again. I realize there may be some people out there that enjoy this type of mindless repetition, but for those who require a little more intellectual stimulation than your average assembly line worker, you will quickly begin to wonder what unimaginative knucklehead decided to make this part of the game.

Super Paper Mario (aka Paper Mario 3) is a good game. I enjoyed playing it; however it is not as good as its two predecessors. It's good that Nintendo changed some things about this game; however, they ended up with the same side scrolling platform-like game, besides the brief moments of Mario in the 3D world, which made the only interesting part of the game.

An RPG has to be in 3D, or at least in perspective view to bring a good feel. I like changes for good. Like another review I read about this game; I loved the fact of Mario having a Jet-pack-like device in Super Mario Sunshine. I loved Zelda, Wind Waker, with its funny graphics (but, if someone changes the Zelda style of game and I'll trash my Nintendo right there). This brought new ideas for the game. But going back for 2D as they did in Paper Mario 3 with only few 3D moments for an RPG is somehow disappointing. I expected more of this game, even though, the graphics were cute.

I was impressed at how well the steering worked.  Now, renting it, we didn't get a wheel, but I was glad to see that you can hold the wiimote flat - buttons up - and tilt it side to side just as well as you can hold it buttons-facing-you and tilt it.  Once I learned this, it became more comfortable to play.

But it didn't become more fun.  There seems to be some argument over the value of the game as a single-player.  I can say first-hand that we had more fun playing together than either of us did on our own.

Mario Kart Wii just bombards you.  You can be sitting in first place, minding your business, just driving along when a Koopa shell hits you.  You fly into the air, land on your wheels, your character shakes his head, and WAM - some ""POW"" block goes off, sending you flying into the air again.  You land, shake your head, and WHACK - another character smacks into you, forcing you to wait while the car spins in place - shake your head AGAIN - and finally drive off.  You're now last place, and have sat there for probably 10 seconds while shouting ""Come on!!!!""

This doesn't happen ALL the time, but you can be confident that when it does, you'll be restarting the race, or quitting altogether.  Sometimes you can get out of this - the best (and really only way I've seen so far) is if you're carrying a Koopa shell yourself - you can launch it backwards to thwart off the first attack.  However, with the POW block, the ink-squirting squid, and the homing ""blue shell"" that's been mentioned elsewhere, you're pretty much S.O.L.  The only good thing is that with some of the attacks - like the POW block, the lightning bolt - it affects everyone around you.  So unless the second place character launched it, you probably won't lose your position.  But in general it becomes frustrating, and I don't think that randomly generated ""frustration"" equates to what some might consider a ""challenge.""

Now, I don't want to hear any of you Wii-addicts start going on about ""Oh you have to have the skill.""  I've said it once and I'll say it again - you're controlling a little cartoon character in a go-kart by tilting a piece of plastic.  There's little skill involved.  I drive a 2000 Dodge Viper GTS coupe - I truly understand the art of ""driving skills.""  Mario Kart Wii is nothing like driving a Dodge Viper!  :)

But I played it for maybe 2, 3 hours, and I'm done.  I won't play it again, and I won't miss it.  On a good note, it's presentation, control interface, and playability is better than most Wii games to date.  My demerits are more against content and gameplay than anything else.  It works very well - it just irritates you in the process!

Here's the good, if you have no experience drawing and you have no idea where to start I'd say that there are worse ways to learn than this. The Art Academy game for DS is actually a pretty great way to set a solid foundation in artistic thinking and techniques. While it seems to mostly focus around technical skills and planning it does give you a free drawing mode to just kinda go to town whenever you feel like it.
For kids who like to draw I could see this being a really cool pass time to have while your on the road or cooped up in a plane.
While there are some limitations to the tools there are enough that you can actually render a pretty decent little sketch.
There are some great starter references and a nice grid to use as well that can be quickly and easily made visible or invisible. As a matter of fact all of the tools can be hidden or revealed very quickly, which is nice.
The tutor ""Vince"" does a pretty good job of helping you understand what it is you're trying to accomplish in the next step and for beginners I can see how this would be a great way to learn. He also allows you to save your progress after each step and skip some of the demonstrations if you want to just get right into it and apply what you've just learned.
Another cool little feature is the ability to save your renders to the gallery and give them different frames. It's kinda cheesy but I liked it.

So here's the bad, the tools feel kinda of natural but they don't act that way. there is no pressure sensitivity that I can tell, only initial touch. So as an experienced illustrator if I press lightly with my pencil I expect a light stroke, but that's not the case here which can get frustrating.
When painting with acrylics or oils, colors painted on top of previously applied wet paints should blend, a least a little, but they don't really seem to here.
I couldn't help shake the feeling that Vince's strokes were a lot more accurate than mine and no matter how careful I was I just couldn't seem to get the accuracy that the game seemed to be pulling off. It did help a bit when I took off my screen protector but not much.

I guess I'd recommend it to beginners and kids who are interested in understanding the technical process of rendering an image or just looking for a little virtual sketch pad that offers a bit more than black and white lines. Granted understanding the process is key and a very important step but you're not going to learn much about the tools despite what Vince might try and convince you to believe.

It's mildly amusing and a decent way to pass some time or sketch out a quick idea on the fly. But if you are familiar with traditional tools you might actually find it more frustrating than anything else.",Great idea but the DS isn't up to it.,1300924800,2,,

3.0,False,"03 25, 2016",A1BQTYVTL2W9RN,B0166QDJDQ,Mokti,"Set in the distant--and I do mean DISTANT--past where stone age tribes are vying for control of a ripe hunting ground to settle in, Primal puts you in the control of a hunter separated from his people, who slowly begins becoming a leader to them as he explores the landscape and gains new powers and knowledge. Among these powers is Beastmastery, which sets him apart in his world, makes him a force to be reckoned with as wolves, bears, and even sabertooth tigers can be tamed to fight for him.

Anyone familiar with Farcry will be right at home in this world. The story is light and the gameplay mostly focuses on capturing bases, gathering materials to upgrade your skills and weapons, and finding the various collectibles scattered throughout the world. Most people I know who played the previous two Farcry games, as well as the last two Tomb Raiders, did so with an emphasis on using the bow as their main weapon, so there's no change there. The lack of guns doesn't really do much to change the game other than shift close-quarters gameplay to melee weapons like clubs or hybrid weapons like spears. Beastmastery adds a fun, pokemon-esque portion to the game as you try to find and tame progressively tougher animals as the story progresses.

Overall, the gameplay is very repetitive and the story is rather light. While several of the characters have startling depth and motivations that are complex and somewhat tragic, you rarely seen evidence of any of that since the story sequences are so few and far between. That being said, the sandbox nature of the game is pleasing for the basic grind... but once you've conquered everything in the progression track, the basic XP missions and random encounters that populate the game to give you a boost, aren't enough to sustain my interest and keep going.

The Mammoth DLC-exclusive is pretty much just a gimmick to get you to buy the game new. It adds a few side missions that I suspect are already on the disc that need to be unlocked with your code (included if you bought new, paid DLC if you didn't). There's also a Ubisoft Club exclusive weapon that you have to buy with real money if you want the full range of weapons, a Bone Shard Dart, but I never felt the desire or need to get it. It's not necessary and only seems to exist to annoy completionists who don't want greyed out items and skills and their menu screen. I'm never a fan of nickel and dime stuff like this and refuse to participate.

Final verdict: Is it worth playing? Eh. I enjoyed myself during the majority of my play time, but got bored after the main quests were done and I had all my upgrades. Replayability is minimum. But I got a solid twenty hours of game time out of it just exploring the world and hunting both beast and man.

Chances are, if you've ever played the original Ghouls N' Goblins or Ghost N ghouls, then you'll know exactly what you're in for. The problem is, Maximo's a more modern take on GnG but offers gameplay that's marred with frustrating control, a lack of dual analog stick action and some of the worst draw distance I've actually seen on the PS2. (Matter of fact, the only other game that suffered with such frustrating controls would be a game called ""Spirits and Spells"" for the Gamecube which was considerably worst)

The main problems of the game would be actually judging the distance of a well timed jump or judging the distance of an attack against an enemy right in front of you who more than most of the time DOES NOT GET HIT.
The enemies have a great system of fighting and their techniques vary. (Not so much with what they're doing, but when they actually do it) Maximo himself is armed with a sword, shield, armor and some neat powers such as a flaming sword, longer sword, a lightsaber-esque looking sword variation and so on. But I found that no matter what I was armed with, the best gameplay approach was TAKING MY TIME. Because not only are the enemies hard and in overwhelming numbers, but levels are riddled with traps such as the ground collapsing on you, arms reaching from the ground sapping health etc.

With that said, here's the good news.

The graphics are good.
The game resembles a gamecube platformer rather than the usual ""jaggy"" games on the PS2. It's smooth, the colors are crisp, rich and vibrant and it really takes advantage of what the PS2's capable of; which is an incredible feat considering this is an early title. Certainly, it doesn't look as good as some PS2 games like Jak and Daxter or Rachet and Clank, but it certainly ranks very high and looks tons better than a good number of PS2 games.

You take on the role of John Vattic, who wakes up in a secure hospital/research facility with a battered, scarred body and a killer headache. He has no idea how he got there or what these people want with him. But he soon learns that he has extraordinary psychic powers such as telekinesis, self-healing, astral projection and the ability to possess baddies.

So begins your quest to find out the whos and whys. Obviously there's a huge government conspiracy behind everything but the game has a unique storytelling twist as you play one level in the present and the next in the past, at the beginning of the story. It's a unique way of developing interest and involving you more in the mystery.

It's very cool being able to sneak up on the baddies and tossing them around like ragdolls with your telekinesis. Chucking them through windows, off high ledges, slamming them into walls and ceilings is loads of fun. But I think this could have been taken further as it was a great opportunity for some cool, gory deaths and the simple blood splatters weren't really enough.

The levels vary between hospitals, Siberian outposts, apartments, more hospitals, offices, sewers, labs and even more hospitals. For the most part they are pretty generic and ludicrously over-sized to make the game longer. It can get a bit boring wandering around for ages, avoiding torrents of gunfire, anxiously awaiting a quiet moment to pull yourself together.

The music also walks a thin line of being atmospheric or generic. Sometimes it can get on your nerves and sometimes it can add to the tension of a scene. The voice acting is a cut above most games however and John Vattic's accent kinda grows on you. There's also a twist, which I won't spoil for you, that makes the game's complicated plot perfect for a theatrical film.

It's fun, but it's long and there are a few annoying bits. And if Second Sight was more developed and detailed it would be a classic. As it is, it's merely fast food.

AI2 was my first venture into this game series, and the experience has ""mediocre"" written all over it. You play as a little fat guy in a grass skirt running around an island, bopping enemies and riding dinosaurs in Mario-like gameplay. It's not a bad game, but it's not really great, either.

The graphic style and appearance of AI2 is cartoon-like. Everything in the backgrounds is drawn really big and is quite colorful, but it also comes across as looking rather flat. There are several different background scenes, such as palm trees, forest, cave, desert, underwater, swamp, and volcanoes. As you progress, you'll occasionally come across a level that stands out from all the others, such as the rolling snow hills on the ice island. But for the most part, the same few backgrounds are repeated and palette-swapped. For example, it's the same forest everywhere you go, but on the volcano island, the sky is orange, and on the ice island, the color scheme is white and blue. The enemies look okay, but they're nothing special. Little snakes, snails, and frogs, and of all things, a killer white rabbit. Most of these enemies left me wondering why I'm even fighting them. Higgins, the main character, looks like a blob. The best thing about the game's graphics are the dinosaurs that Higgins can hitch a ride on and the bosses. The dinosaurs are drawn well, look cool, and I like their animation. The bosses are huge and well-detailed. Overall, the graphics aren't bad, just a bit bland.

The sound in this game isn't all that bad. Many of the themes are kind of catchy and upbeat, and some attempt to be dark and moody. But none of it really stands out, and it's not composed too well. It's a bouncy calypso style that's just about as basic as NES music can get. It changes quite frequently, which prevents it from becoming too annoying, but I just didn't find myself really wanting to hum these tunes. In fact, if they had stuck in my head, that would probably be a bad thing. I did particularly like the boss theme and the underwater music, though. The sound effects are nothing special and are the basic 8-bit ""boings"" and ""bonks"".

Once again, what could have been a decent gameplay experience is dragged down to ""average"" because of somewhat bad play control. Granted, this game's play control isn't overly bad, but there are times when it glitches up in the worst possible situations. Normally, if I run along and start jumping, Higgins will jump as far as possible without any problem. But when there comes a time when you MUST jump really far to get over an enemy or flaming pile of sticks, Higgins will come up short and land on the life-depriving object! It must be a conspiracy. You can hold down the B button to run faster, but when I tried to stop, I often lost all control of Higgins as he went skidding around. There are times when you need to make run-assisted longjumps over gaps, but Higgins keeps going when I wanted him to stop, and either careens into an enemy, or falls into another pit. The control seems to improve a bit when you ride the red and blue dinosaurs, but the momentum problem when running is still there. Also...that plesiosaurus is supposed to improve your control underwater, but all he does is make me a bigger target, and he's slow, too.

After being bonked on the head by a coconut, Higgins awakens...and then proceeds to run around an island bonking animals on the head. The manual states that this game is actually about rescuing a princess from aliens, but that's not very original. Adventure Island 2 is also lacking in atmosphere. Its cut-and-paste backgrounds, simplistic music, and run-of-the-mill level designs don't exude the feeling of being on an adventure-filled island very well. Master Higgins is not really appealing as a character to me, either, and the game just seems to lack personality, despite having a few cool dinosaur friends.

Due to the cartoony graphics, many people may think this game would be quite easy just from looking at it. While it starts off easy, you'll soon find out that the game is, in fact, quite difficult. Unfortunately, rather than make tough enemies and interesting level design, it seems like the programmers took every annoying thing a game could possibly have to make it challenging, and throw it at you. First of all, don't be fooled by the ""Continue"" option on the title screen. You cannot continue unless you find the Hudson Bee, hidden in one of the early levels. Another pervasive problem is that you aren't automatically given a weapon. You have to find a stone axe inside an egg somewhere in the level (and they don't exist in all levels.) If you die, you lose the weapon. This is not good. If you find that guy who offers to let you skip the island, decline him, because you'll need to store up weapons and dinosaurs from the early levels in order to get through the later levels. While this may seem like whining about the way the game is designed and meant to be played, it is just far too easy to end up getting so far into the game and not be able to progress because I ran out of weapons. When that happens, I pretty much have to start all over again, which isn't a good thing when considering that the actual in-game challenge and level design is nothing spectacular. The boss fights are entertaining, but they don't excuse the multitude of lackluster areas you have to slog through to get to them.

Even if this game's technical problems with the controls and continue system were not present, I still can't help but feel this game would be boring. There are eight islands to explore, each progressively more difficult. It seems like the designers were trying to make the game more like Super Mario Bros. 3 in this way. But unlike SMB3, you can't control where Higgins goes on the map. He may take a different route than the one you played the last time. Some may say this is ""original"" and makes the game feel ""new"" each time you play...until you realize the levels are all so similar to each other, that it really doesn't matter where he goes. And it's really annoying when you're one stage away from the boss level, and instead of going right to the boss, Higgins makes a beeline for another stage. As you move through the levels, Higgins's life meter constantly goes down. You can replenish it by collecting food along the way. But you must get to the end of the level before it runs out. This is AI2's version of a timer. I am not really fond of having to rush through levels, and in many of AI2's levels, if you hurry, make no mistakes, and collect every fruit along the way, you'll still just barely make it to the end in time. This means I often have to sacrifice dinosaurs when I would have rather stopped to fight. The dinosaurs are kind of fun to use, but they really can't save what is essentially very average gameplay. There's also this little ""Choose an Egg"" game at the end of each level, but all you usually get is points. Points aren't necessary in a game like this! Why not give a useful item or weapon?

Having never played Adventure Island 1, I was unable to comment on how Adventure Island 2 may have improved on or been worse than its predecessor, but it's probably just as well that I reviewed it as a game all on its own. It's really, really average. I've never finished it, because I usually get bored with it by the time I reach the third island. The boss fights are fun, but that's about the only good thing I can really say about it. The rest of the game is just an average sidescroller that tries in many ways to be like Mario, but falls short. And an average game gets an average score.","It's not a bad game, but it's not really great, either.",1419033600,,,

Let me start by saying that I have not played the 07 or 08 version, so the putting issue is something with which I am not familiar.  The last TW game I played was the 06 version for PC, but some things have still not been addressed by EA.  Back to that in a bit.

First, the good.  There are many courses that are interesting to play, including a few that have not been on previous editions.  While I would have liked to see some of the ""fantasy"" courses present on my earlier PC editions, the variety of courses is pretty good here.  The graphics are also good.

The bad, as others have mentioned, is the inability to take a half swing.  If you need to hit a shot about 75 yards, it is practically impossible.  Full wedge shots can only be hit at 98% or so, flying the green.  I have personally resorted to hitting punch shots with my pitching wedge, then hoping to get good bounces.  This works as long as there are no bunkers or lakes in my way.  Inside of 50 yards, the pitch shot generally works fine.  So, be prepared to really think your way around the course, laying up if you cannot get the ball within 50 yards of the green.  Over 100 yards is fine.  Under 50 can be dealt with.  In between is a disaster.

I saw today that the 2010 version is coming out in June.  Hopefully this earlier release of the next version is because of the complaints about the 2009 version, and these half shots will not be an issue in the new game.  The sad thing is, all the work I have done to max out my skills will be gone down the tubes... but I'll trade that for a game with fewer flaws.","It's not horrible, and it's not great",1237420800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

********POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! ALERT!!!********( PART ENDS WITH * LINE)

The story is crazy and over the top which is something I don't mind because that is what you get when you buy a saints row game. It's not bad but I found the last one to be a little better. Again, the game takes place in Steelport but, it is in a virtual world. When starting the story, the main character (leader of the Saints)is now President of The United States of America. You'll go do a couple of things and then all of a sudden, there's aliens that start taking your crew and everyone else in the White House. Your character eventually gets taken. When heading back to earth, earth gets blown up. Now you're stuck on a ship and if you want to go back to ""earth"" you will have to do so in a simulator. This may sound weird but I like being on REAL earth better. I miss it to be honest (Laugh Out Loud). I kind of wish they did that differently.

The story is short but it isn't bad. This time, you are fighting against one faction instead of multiple gangs like the last few games. You know how when you have your favorite song come on and you want to listen but you have to stop listening to it  because you have to get out of a vehicle in order to do a mission, buy weapons, etc.? Well not anymore! You can always listen to songs whether you're running down pedestrians in a car or on foot. One of the features that I wish they took from Saints Row 2 was the ability to replay missions. I'll sometimes get bored with freeroam and want to play a few of the main missions. I don't know why they got rid of it.

There isn't too much of a difference between 3 and 4 in my opinion. There are some new weapons and a few other things but still. This feels more like an add on but overall, even though I'll sometimes get bored playing IV, it's good and it's fun. $30 is a little overpriced for just the game by itself in my opinion but it is the maximum price I'd get it for. I got my copy the with all the content for $30 and it was worth the price. If you like crazy, over the top games, this is the game for you.

I started playing the second game soon after that. Had been about a week? Since it had released. After hearing about how people with really beefy computers were already suffering from frame rate issues I was a bit worried. Then once the game was started and I checked out the visuals in the options found all my settings on auto were ""very low"" that's not good. I know my computer is old (about 8 years now) but it was a top of the line computer back then and still can run games like crysis and Dishonored 1 no problems.

After deciding to play the game on medium visual levels I was able to play through till about the island level. Once I got there I started suffering major frame rate/lag issues. I finally succumbed to putting my visuals down to ""very low"" on everything. I still suffered the same stuff. It's basically unplayable currently which is a shame. I was enjoying it for the most part up till then.

Even though a lot of people will point out ""it's your own fault your computer is old get a new one"" or something like that. Even newer computers have been suffering problems so I don't think it's completely my computers fault. Though this has caused me to contemplate spending another 2 grand on a new gaming computer when mine runs quite well so far.

Anyways, for the game it's fun that they allow you to choose between either Corvo, or Emily. Hearing rumors that each play through is different in a few ways at least. The visuals look pretty good, along with the sound. The first part of the game without powers is a bit difficult when your used to powers in the first game and the DLC.

The changes they made to some of the powers aren't as good as I feel they should have been. Such as the eye, even though they seemed over powering in the first game, here they barely do much at all. Unless you're really close to the target you won't see them very easily, also it's kinda like a heart beat/sonar type where you have to wait for a thud noise before it branches out a small area to show you where people are around you. I also came across a point where I chocked out a guard, and then one other guard threw a grenade and I got out but it killed the other guard that was unconscious. At the end of the very long level I had played it showed I had killed someone when I had been careful not to. That means having to re-play the whole level over again because of some stupid AI. That is a bit of an annoyance to.

These are small annoyances but they start to add up. I have only played a bit of Corvos side so I don't know about Emily but ill find out next time I try the game out. But I will wait longer till they release a few more patches to iron out more of the bugs because as most game developers these days, they rush things and then try and fix it once it's already out.

Pros:
1. Getting to play as either Corvo or Emily is a lot of fun and adds replay-ability
2. New story to continue the fun one in the first game is great
3. New locations make it even more fun

Cons:
1. The frame rate/lagging problems that even the best computers are experiancing because of a rushed product.
2. The powers seemed to have been reduced or weakened in this game which kinda makes it less fun in some situations
3. Having to replay a huge mission because a enemy killed one of their own and counting it as a kill for you when your trying to do a non-lethal play through is annoying.
4. Replacing the voice actor for ""the outsider"" was a bad choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the voice actor for the first game way more.
5. At one point (the island level) the frame rate was so bad I couldn't play the game, even on the lowest video settings.

For now this is a fun game, up to a point. Then it becomes quite difficult to play any more because of problems they need to fix. Once Arcane Studios releases a patch or two to fix some of these frame rate problems then maybe I can finish reviewing this game and enjoy it. Until then I will have to wait, which is not fun when you buy a game new and expect to be able to play it right away.

New developer Locomotive took over for Pandemic with this installment, and there are some changes.

The Wii control scheme is similar to Metroid Prime 3, but it doesn't work as seamlessly, in part because Metroid is first-person and Willy is third-person.  When Crypto is too close to another object, the camera moves into a pseudo-first-person view that becomes hard to control.  It's also hard to get Crypto shooting where you want him in a mass firefight -- he has to be pointing the right way, even if you can put the cursor on what you want to shoot.  As with Metroid, you can't get too excited while playing -- move the Wiimote too far to the side and it loses sight of the sensor bar, and you lose control of the character.  However, the controls aren't terrible -- especially considering it's obvious from early dialogue that the game was planned for the PS2 and ported to Wii later.

The graphics are disappointing compared to other Wii titles; they're on a par with the previous PS2 outing, although the Wii's superior hardware doesn't drop frames when things get busy the way the PS2 did.

The biggest disappointment, though, is the writing.  The sarcasm, wit, and biting satire of the previous two games is oddly absent.  There's a lot of puerile jokes about Big Willy, but relatively little skewering of the 70s.  Worse, Crypto no longer has the ability to read minds -- so the joy of listening to all the twisted inner thoughts of the game's residents is gone.  True, you can hear some remarks by wandering around wearing someone else's body, but they're relatively few and more repetitive than in the past.  The result is a game that has the mechanics that made the series good, but it's missing the soul that made it excellent.","Almost more of the same, but not quite",1204416000,8,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

3.0,False,"12 1, 2008",A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0012N3T3Y,Sky,"Either I've gotten much better at first person shooters since the original Resistance came out 2 years ago, or Resistance 2 is just a lot easier and shorter than Resistance 1. Unfortunately, I can confirm that I have NOT gotten any better at FPS games...as much as I love to play them. Therefore, Resistance 2 is simply easier and shorter than Resistance 1.

One thing is for sure: Resistance 2 is at minimum as much fun to play as Resistance 1. So why, you may ask, would my overall rating of the game be only 3 stars? Because Resistance 2 was: 1) too short, 2) too easy and 3), most disappointingly, did not allow for co-op play (like Resistance 1 did) of the campaign. There are indeed on and offline multiplayer co-op modes...but not of the campaign. And that's a big minus for me. I played through the campaign of Resistance 1 in co-op mode several times with my kids and friends and that option is sorely missed in R2.

Don't get me wrong...playing both on or offline co-op in R2 is indeed very fun. There are various missions that you can set up and play with friends. But it's just not the same as playing through the campaign...it's just not.

The campaign consists of (only) 7 levels of exhilarating battles against a plethora of creatures that you use a plethora of weapons to defeat (and they'll use most of them against you too). To really put the campaign plot of the game in context (if you care about the plot), it's well worth the visit to the official Resistance web site; there's a ton of story there that I'd bet 90% of the people who start the game are unaware of. For me, the story helps me ""get more into character"" for the game, and R2 picks up right where R1 left off.

Your campaign weapons in R2 are as plentiful as they were in R1. HOWEVER, and I actually liked this better, you are only able to carry 2 weapons at a time instead of stockpiling every weapon you come across. Most of the R1 weapons are back...some slightly modified. The Bullseye Mach II is readily available right at the early stages of R2 versus only in the very latter stages of R1; it's very useful on the enemies that you encounter most throughout the game. You also get several mean weapons that are new to R2 (like the Wraith and the Chimaran Marksman). I found that grenades were not as key to survival in R2 as they were in R1. There were level in R1 that were virtually impossible without grenades; I didn't find that was the case in R2.

Perhaps the most improved feature of R2 is the health system. In R1 everyone who's played it will recall the annoying system of having to find health syrums throughout the game. R2 has moved to a more&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-4/dp/B0016B28WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty 4</a>&nbsp;like system where finding cover immediately replenishes your health. Although, now that I think of it, this probably contributed heavily to how much easier R2 seemed than R1.  The controller's aiming and meleeing schematic was also rearranged a bit to be more Call of Duty-like.

Again similar to R1, there are no maps in R2, which at times was frustrating. Let me tell you that if the phrase ""the best route is not always the most obvious ever applied to trying to get from here to there"" it applies in this game on more than one occasion.

Finally, unlike R1, in R2 you'll never be required to control any vehicles or Chimaran craft.

If you just like wasting nasty beasts without regard to a story, then my concerns about a short game and no co-op to enjoy with others won't affect you as much as it did me. Rest assured, the story won't help you beat the enemies or evade the barrage of defenses that will be fired at you by them. I'm glad that I played R1 before R2, and I recommend starting with that (and R1 is cheap on Amazon too&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resistance-Fall-Of-Man/dp/B000JLIXIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resistance: Fall Of Man</a>). But playing R1 first certainly isn't necessary to enjoying R2.

Resistance 2 has an M (mature gamers only) rating just as Resistance 1 did. There's a bit more cursing in R2 than R1, but both Resistance games really only deserved T (teen) ratings. But I'm perhaps a bit more liberal when it comes to what I think will warp a kid's mind, so you'll need to use your own discretion if you're thinking of this as a gift for someone under the age of 18.

Multi-player is cool too. Multi-player is not like co-op where you play missions with friends. In Multi-player you battle (with or without your friends) against other onliners.

You've been promoted from Sgt. to Lt. Nathan Hale. As far as you know, up to the start of R2 you've been the only one with a Resistance to the Fall of Man. But things may be different than what you thought before being introduced to R2's Doctor Malikov...very different.

3.0,False,"10 28, 2016",A3VXF52UFKKIYI,B01GW3ODBU,Shawn,"UPDATE: Have run into game breaking bugs that crash the game five times now. Bethesda doesn't fix their games. If an unofficial patch comes out in the modding scene, it will disable your trophies. So you can't play a bug free Skyrim without disabling trophies. Bummer.

All mods disable trophy acquirement. Even a mod that changes the color of a butterfly's wings. Yes, every mod.

This remaster is a little shoddy. First of all, it's a remaster for full price, and it features all the DLC that everyone in the world bought. So, there's nothing new here. The other thing is, if you've sunk months into the original Skyrim on PC or consoles, there is nothing new here, other than a new coat of paint. It definitely looks like a PS3 game that's been up-res'd to next gen. And if you've played the heck out of old Skyrim, coming back is underwhelming, aside from the coat of paint, because there is absolutely zero gameplay improvements, or bug fixes. If you've explored Skyrim before, you'll feel underwhelmed replaying all of it. Because, it's sad to say, aside from the world building that Bethesda is good at, the gameplay is very dull, and boring. You'll get sucked into the world, but the gameplay mechanics and the endless questing gets tiresome, especially if you've seen and done all of this before.

Noticeable problems are that sound cuts out a lot during gameplay. The opening action scene, in which a dragon attacks a village, is full of sound audio that cuts out randomly. A dragon will screech, setting the town ablaze, and then the audio will suddenly cut out, leaving you a soundless animation. Also, there seems to be a delay in sound audio. A dragon lands next to me, and the sound of him hitting the ground came 5 seconds later. What a wonderful fix here!

Bethesda is notorious for not giving a damn about fixing bugs from their engine. They figure modders will do it. But mods are only useful if playing on PC, not consoles. There may be an unofficial patch that comes later to consoles, but right now, it is absent. This is lazy developing on Bethesda's part.

That, and Bethesda also recently announced that they will no longer be giving out review copies of their games to news outlets. Meaning, you will no longer see review scores before a game is released. They're doing this because they want to be lazy and make money on opening day, and having any negative review scores hurts their opening day sales. There's no other excuse for this. And, if people accept this, more developers will start doing the same thing. This means you will not have any means to see if a game is good or bad. They basically want you to buy on impulse that it'll be good, even if, like this remaster, little effort was put into it.

Bethesda has lost a fan with this practice. It started with never fixing their bugs, then trying to charge people for mods, and now eliminating day 1 reviews. They're very anti-consumer, and it proves it with this remaster. They added a coat of paint, or just turned on new settings by moving old Skyrim from their old engine, to their new Fallout 4 engine, then slapped a $60 price tag on it. They didn't even up the frames per second to 60.

Overall, you've played Skyrim before, and if you haven't, you may find this dated gameplay enjoyable, but it gets old after a while. Stay away, or buy it used, to spite Bethesda's practice.

PS: IF you're looking for mods to make this gameplay better than before, know that there only about 20 mods for this game, and none of them are revolutionary. They range from wearing a ring that makes it so you cheat through the game with unlimited carry weight, to unkillable dogs, to a cloudless Skyrim. It's really pointless. That, and Sony has made it so no new assets can be added to the game, and the max size for a mod is 1GB, compared to 6 on Xbox One, or unlimited on PC. This means, don't expect any story-level expansions to be added via mods.","New coat of paint, same problems as before.

3.0,False,"08 5, 2017",A35042IWDE456Y,B01GW3P6PC,Vincent,"First some disclaimers:
1. This is a online DRM game, meaning you have to have stable internet connection, and be subscribed to PlayStation Plus (PS+) in order to play this game.

2, A Ubisoft Club (free) account is required. You cannot bypass or skip this option like in the Assassin Creed or other Ubisoft games.

3. 16GB patch (as of this review) and 9gb HDD install required. Takes around 20mins before starting the game initially, may want to grab a quick bite to eat or have a quick shower as it's loading in the background.

4. This game is an Snowboard, skiing, winter sport simulator. If you're expecting an arcade winter sports game like SSX, then you'll be VERY disappointed.

Now onto the review:

Going to say this right off the bat, if the title didn't give it off already: unless you're a winter sport enthusiast, this game will not hold your attention past the few hour mark as you'll be seeing the same landscapes/courses with different slope angles and trees/rocks/cabin placements.  At around 3 to 4 hours you feel like you're doing the same thing and just grinding points for loot and unlocks.

Graphics in the game is amazing. Very nice detail in the landscapes. Excellent replay videos as it shows off a lot of angles during your run. Highly recommended that you view these after a run down the slope

The UI in this game is really bad as you'll be moving around a mouse cursor at times on a console no-less. No idea why they didn't opt for text entry highlights

Gameplay:
As stated before this game is not an arcade snowboarder like SSX. Tough to get into as it's not really that fluid (seeing that it's a snowboard simulator). You will need a lot of patients to enjoy this game as the controls are really tight in high level courses

As a comparison it's like how Skate is to Tony Hawk 2, but more drastic. In terms of tricks there is only flips and grabs as you slide down the slope. There's no rail grinding or ubers. The window for most flips and grabs is very low on most courses and most of the time you're just trying not to stumble and fall. You get a narrow overhead view on what's happening, instead using the left thumb stick for camera it's used for fine tuning movement which i find a bit odd, but good for the simulator aspect i guess.

You are able to free roam to most courses. Some courses have level caps. Again, after a few hours you practically seen it all even when unlocking levels the variety is not that drastic, just obstacles are harder to move around

After the initial load of a few minutes to connect to the ubisoft servers, there's no loading or frame rate stutters whatsoever when playing (assuming you have stable internet connection). Best played in bulk (or binge gaming) as if you just plan to boot up this game for a few course runs then the load times may be an issue, and may second guess if you want to play the game or not

Aside from course unlocks, you can unlock gear with point you earned during your runs. You can also pay real world money for these cosmetics if you want so there is dlc and micro transactions in the game. There are microtransactions in terms of events in game, you have to pay in order to get into the winterfest event for example which is a bit disappointing. Not sure why micro transactions exists as there's tons of sponsorship and ads in the game

Seeing that its an online game you will meet other players. Like most PlayStation owners no one will use their mics or don't have one. Some to low level players have no idea what they're doing in terms of how to group up or join the same race (or simply ignore you?). High level players, after seeing you don't have a near perfect single run (most top scores in all courses are achieved already*), or high outfitted gear will ignore you entirely

*As of this point you cannot be on the top of the leaderboard unless there's you join a paid event as you can only match the top score. Seeing you're not the first to achieve it, you just have to be added to the list with others that came before you

Overall, I think this game is very niche. Unless you have a very high interest in winter sports i'd stay away form this game",Chances of getting you money's worth (at ~$30)?

I bought GOW3 without prior playing and let me tell you that even tough I play almost 2 hours daily (mainly FPS, TPS and racing games) when I played GOW3 for the first minutes I got a sensation that haven't felt long time ago: I got boring and frustrated. Memories come to mind when back in the 80's I played joystick-destructive games like Decathlon or some arcade games where you just have to push a lot of the same buttons many times, very fast and in the same position until the enemy died. My hands got hurt. And as I told you before: I'm a gamer and play all nights but I never recall feeling exhausted and with hurt fingers since the early days of video gaming. I had NO FUN and thought many times how could someone say that this is a MUST HAVE game? The battles with the enemies are pointless and not rewarding at all. I don't know if I am accustomed to FPS/TPS games because in those games you can feel the INTENSE ACTION at all times but when fighting with the GOW3 enemies I got bored pretty quickly because of the succession of just pressing certain buttons at the time and then other button and there other button and then the other buttons in a MECHANICAL not fun at all way. So in few words: learn about the Hack and slash genre and see if that is a genre you could handle. I can PROUDLY say that I love my PS3 but I didn't like GOW3.

You have a map with a small number of planets (14 on a small map, 20 on a medium map, 50 on a large map--I don't see how anyone would have time to play this on a large map), and it takes really LONG time for ships to move between these planets.

The thing you need to know about this game is that it's slow. There's nothing to do besides watch your ships fight it out. Battles can take forever. There's little strategy involved. Once you've figured out the best technology to research and best ships to build, there's really not much planning or thinking required.

The technology research is very generic. You research stuff that gives you more powerful shields and armor, more powerful weapons, or unlock new ships. On the civilian side, the key technologies to research are unlocking trading ports (because you need to build them to get more money), and early warning radar so you know when enemy ships are coming. Other than that, there are no key technologies that alter the game. It's not like Civilization where you really feel the pain of falling behind in research.

The AI isn't very bright. It will harass your planets if you put it on ""agressor"" mode, but it's really bad at going in for the kill and actually taking you over. On ""hard"" level, the computer players have massively more ships than you do, but are too stupid to use them effectively.

3.0,False,"03 12, 2014",A3PDYHA2GC9AW1,B00GV4V8XC,Bryan,"I've been playing role playing games since Final Fantasy 1 was new, so I thought I'd give this game a go given the comparisons to the classics. Unfortunately, Bravely Default falls completely flat with its characters and story, and the battle system is nothing special.

The game has a class system that is incredibly similar to the also overrated Final Fantasy V: you can choose to be any class you want on any character, and mix the skill sets from any two classes at a time. This gives the game a lot of strategy on the surface, but just like FFV, the class balance is terrible at times. Some classes have insanely overpowered skills, while others will have you wondering why they even exist at all. Take the merchant, for one. This class will help you earn more money, but its skills cost money to use. Why would you want to give up stats to take a class whose only benefit (more money) is counteracted by the fact that you need to spend all your money to get the benefit of his skills? It's just a class that you'd level up for the sake of having its passive skills, and then dumping for a ""real"" class. That's always the issue to me with games that have a class system. Why are so many classes not viable? Every class should be a legitimately good choice for a main specialization that you'll use through the game. That's simply not the case here. It does not feel like much effort was put into making every class a genuine contender. It's obvious that some classes merely exist because, well, why not? Might as well throw more into the game to give the illusion of choice, right?

The battle system has a gimmick that is being touted as refreshing and unique and strategic. I'm not impressed with it. What it comes down to is that you have some control over when your characters take their turn. You can take a lot of turns all at once, but you will wait that many turns after to act again. It's not a new concept in a turn-based RPG to have some ability to control when your characters act in battle. With Bravely Default, you have so much control that it almost becomes a fault in the game. For example, obviously in almost any non-boss battle all you're going to do is use all your turns right away to kill everything in round 1, or kill as much as possible before the AI has a chance to act. For most of the game you can just put it on auto battle with that as your setting, and you'll be fine. The only time you need to change it up is on bosses where you might need to defend from a special attack on a given turn, or save turns on your healer so you can heal the right people when needed.

All that being said, the above complaints are not meant to say that this is a bad game, just that it's not nearly as original or well designed as I would have hoped. It has high production values, good presentation, good sound, and a lot of great options. Overall it's definitely a competent RPG, and gives fans of old-school RPGs another game to mess around with using a formula that a lot of people still like.

If the review ended here, I'd be giving the game at least 4 stars, but I have one more complaint that really bothers me enough that I considered dropping the score even more than I did: The characters and story in this game are really awful. I absolutely can't stand the narrative or the script. One of your main characters spends the entire game just making lewd comments about women, even as the other party members tell him to stop. He's not even the only one - there are at least two other instances where characters were portrayed as being extremely rude towards women. I realize this is supposed to be a joke, but in life, a joke stops being funny when it's making those around you uncomfortable. It's not that I'm offended or have no sense of humor. It's that I want a character to be more than just a series of pick up lines and rude commentary. The character is one-dimensional. Being lustful isn't just one aspect to him, it's virtually the only aspect. The fact that he ignores the pleas of the women to stop makes it uncomfortable.

In the end, if you loved Final Fantasy V and games like it, you might love this game if you can ignore the terrible story and characters. You might even be not quite as annoyed as I was - I'm guessing most people weren't. Still, I thought it would be helpful to lend another voice to the large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews, because the game absolutely has flaws and is not for everyone.","Overrated rehash, but it's not terrible",1394582400,10,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",

The firefights are some of the best I have ever seen or been involved in.  The graphics are phenomenal but I don't think they quite compare with Half-Life 2.  Overall, the physics, graphics, and intensity make for one of the most innovative FPS to come out in a while.  Mostly.  I bought this game yesterday and just finished playing it so maybe over-exposure is helping write this review.

  The one thing about this game is that it became less fun to play as I went along. At first I was thrilled with the enemy A.I. and the hellacious combat.  The creepy apparitions and supernatural phenomenon actually made me jump in my seat.  There was a constant chill whenever that disembodied voice would speak to me.  The problems began about halfway through the game.  After a while it becomes repetitious.  The creepy voice becomes more annoying than anything and the random apparition appearances become tiresome.  They keep trying to scare you with the same thing over and over and it quickly loses any fear factor.

  I guess the level design is my biggest problem with this game.  I can't remember how many air vents,tunnels, or corridors I had to go through to get to get past the locked door to the next room.  The levels themselves are rather bland except for the lighting effects.  And what's with the flashlight?  It only works for like 20 seconds before needing a recharge.  What super-soldier is going to use a crap flashight?  Why not night-vision goggles?  Or thermographic vision?  Also, I always kept getting stuck behind things.  Chairs that had fallen over, fire-extinguisher boxes sticking out of the wall etc.  It always seemed to happen when I was in a fire-fight too.

  There is a considerable amount of backtracking and there is no map function.  Sometimes you are stuck wandering around trying to find your vague mission objective.  Also I wish they had included more detail on your objectives and some sort  of confirmation when you completed it.  Most mission objectives read like ""Find so-and-so's Office.""  And that's it.  Your left to running around and looking for one poorly marked door.  It gets a little frustrating.  By the end of the game, the battles have gotten a little stale since there are so few different enemies and the entire final level is a complete let down.  And I still have no idea what the plot was. It's convoluted and makes no sense when I try to figure it out.  The psychic flashbacks become bothersome and also repetitive.  It's almost like the nightmare levels of Max Payne.  Overall, the best part of this game is the first half of it where most of the replay value lies.  This game is fresh and exciting, but it really drags as the ""story"" unfolds towards the end, and it has the same crap ending like most other recent FPS'.",Bell Curve,1130025600,,,

Unfortunately, that was not the case.
To start out with, the graphics are amazingly smooth and may be the best of any racing simulator released as of yet. Even on a standard television it looks great, but hook it up to your HDTV and be prepared for an awesome visual experience. But where they've succeeded graphically, they really fell behind on the content and layout. Having to drive to Timbuktu and back just to find a race is ridiculous, and the customization that existed to a certain extent in previous installments is pretty much gone. On top of that, Crash Junctions are again non-existent, and instead we get the ability to just ""crash"" anywhere we want and proceed to bounce around all over the place, taking out transportation along the way. While this is fun for a while, it does get to be old, and lacks the extreme fun factor of, say, Burnout ""Takedown"" or ""Revenge"" with the actual Crash Junction setup. Should we see another installment of ""Burnout,"" we can only hope they bring these back.
Also, it really boggles my mind what they were thinking when they set up directional markers on these tracks. There are none. All you get is a small little map and compass which are pretty much useless, and you're left with memorizing the tracks before you have a legitimate shot at beating them. Add to the mix the lack of multiplayer support except for online, and this title really disappoints on some key factors.

I was hoping it would be A LOT better than the great game Desert Combat, but it might be only so-so better. This expansion pack is buggy and I have some crash issues (already had some, so really more), and it has some new guns that are good, but not great. It also has some vehicals that are just whatever and the maps are only so-so too. Playing the night maps is frusterating and I want to shoot and move, not bumble around in the dark.

As a matter of fact, it has no storyline. The start of the game has an fmv intro, this is the only piece of dialogue shared by the characters in the entire game. The only backstory is obtained by reading the guide, which suggests that your team, which consists of extremely opposing personalities, just happen to be immune and end up together. Despite everyone these guys knew and loved died two weeks ago, these guys don't seem too shook up about it.

The only goal is to survive, the most complex the game gets is having to activate something, an event that for sometimes no reason at all, summons a hoard of zombies. The ""bosses"" the game suggests are not bosses at all, but random popup special zombies that exhibit special properties. You will run into many of them in each level, and are only slightly more difficult than your basic level mob. Even the tanks are only really tough in enclosed spaces or when you are caught by surprise. So that makes only five basic enemies you will verse in the entire game. No zombie dogs, birds, or any other classic zombie enemies.

My other beef with the game I have is the behavior of the zombies. They sit or stand around doing nothing (occasionally vomitting). You never see them eating the corpse of another human or trying to break through a door, which I don't think gives them too much of a realistic effect.

Besides that, the game has an incredible amount of detail, and is rather fun. People talk about the AI director and how incredible it is, but all it really does is cause random popping, which is something that has existed in rpg's for years. Admittedly it is more advanced, but still, random repoping does not mean ""different experience every time"".

Besides that fact, it is a fun game, and perhaps even worth owning on those days you feel like killing some zombies. Also, I imagine it could be a pretty fun party game when a group of people get together and want to have some fun zombie murder maham. And since that is the main point of the game's design, I suppose I can't hate it too much. I hope in the next left 4 dead, they bring a better storyline and we have a chance to learn more about our characters and hear more of their amusing dialogue.

Update:

After so much time playing this game (because my wife is absolutely addicted to it and won't stop playing), I have realized that this game has many many faults. Mostly, it is incredibly glitchy. I am often shocked at how many glitches I experience with this game, considering how simple the game is. After playing the likes of fallout 3, I find it embarrassing how glitchy this game can be, considering how much less detail, quality, and quantity of stuff was put into this game. This is better suited as an open source game for the amount of care put into it. I guess this shows you that you don't need to put time or effort into a game to make it a top seller, and there is no proportionality to the amount of effort, money, and work and how addicted people will become to it.

Maybe I am being a bit too critical, but it just bugs me how a game so devoid of any real effort by the programmers could become so popular.

But this home console port of the game is kind of mediocre.  The core of the game is still there but there is a long load time before the start of each match like there was with MK2 for the SNES.  Another major flaw I found in the game is that the computer AI never blocks low so you can continually sweep the opponent over and over until they die or fill up their super meter bar where they launch a super move against you.  Another disappointing aspect of the arcade translation was that the endings are all kind of messed up and are different than the arcade game.  Another big irritation is the 3 button super moves.  The SNES control and top buttons make it hard to synchronize all 3 buttons at once to pull off the level 3 super moves.

Those gripes aside the game is still pretty solid.  The wide variety of characters adds a lot of replay value.  You can tell that the SNES capabilities were being stretched to their limits to be able to function the game.  Every time I play I notice how easy M. Bison is in this game compared to the first Alpha game where he was a cheap bastard.  The storylines and different end battles I thought were pretty cool.  The game isn't all bad but really pales in comparison to the Playstation version and arcade game.

Makes you wonder if Nintendo should have let Capcom make SF Alpha the first game for the SNES instead with much fewer characters and stages.  Overall the game is about 3  stars.  Similar to Killer Instinct which seemed very butchered for the SNES.  SF Alpha 2 does not hold the same arcade feel and magic to the game.

And the fact it was being done by Hudson Soft (the same guys who did Mario Party 1, 2 and the upcoming 3)made me confident it would be good. Now it's here... and I'm happy and disapointed. Let me start with the good. First, the graphics: they're very good. The game uses the cel-shaded thing for the characters, like Jet Grind Radio did; this was a good idea. The levels are well rendered and colorful. Second, the controls. They're pretty simple. Not as simple as Mario Party, but simple nevertheless. The mini-games' controls are tight and responsive and moving around the board is pretty easy. The mini-games are lots of fun and the sounds are good with the voices of all the characters from Sonic Adventure. Now, the bad. First, no online play. It was orignally going to be in the game, but it was taken out. Second, the AI (Artifical Intelligence). This is what almost destroys the game and is by far the biggest problem. When you pick a card to move, only you can see your own cards, the next player can only see his own cards, and so on. When you play against the computer, when they pick one of your cards,(it happens a lot)they always pick the card they need: I.E. they are 5 spaces away from a Precious Stone, and don't have a 5. You have a 5. They pick from you and they always get the 5. And this happens on every difficulty level, even Easy mode! Strangely, while the computer players seem psychic on the board, in the mini-games, they are very dumb. Plus, the load times are a little longer then they should be.

I hired it and got up to level 6 when I took it back. I didn't get far because I spent about an hour a day on it because this game is annoying and hard. On the first 5 levels it's hard to use stealth(unlike conflict desert storm), it's not linear, it's just enemies run out write away when going into a new area. You can run out of ammo easily(unlike conflict desert storm 1/2).

There are now booby traps in it so because you're in a jungle and there are a lot of plants(it's harder to notice them)you have to hold the left trigger and B to get your comrades to disarm it(you have to always look for them and it slows the pace down).

The way you can disarm traps is the way you can get your men to pick up weapons(and more like heal others and use gun turret)instead of doing it your self when switching character.

You can only save twice(even on easy), we want as much as we want like PC games. A level can go on for along time because there can be too many enemies in black clothes running around.

There're missions or ""primary objectives"" like ""escape"" and ""Bonus objectives"" like ""collect dog tags"" or ""get important documents"". After each level you can build your stats up(Sniping, medic skills...).

This is just like the previous games except it's in a jungle(like Metal gear, Splinter Cell 2 and Ghost Recon on Playstation 2...).

3.0,False,"08 16, 2004",A26PAN8REXYBYH,B00006C2HA,Brian M. Ranzoni,"12 years after wincing my way through the originals, I picked up id Software's latest from my local Fred Meyers last Tuesday. By Saturday morning I watched the end credits scroll past my traumatized eyes. Clearly, id went old-school gameplay with the latest graphics in *Doom 3*.

*D3* plays like *Quake*. It's dark and alien looking. Doors open automatically or you use the fire key to activate buttons. You have no alt-fire, stealth, lean, or use functions.

You do have a story for once. *Half-Life* owes about half its plot to the original *Doom*: both games are about clearing research facilities of teleporting monsters from another dimension, and id did it first. But *D3* plays like a devilish mod of *Half-Life: Blue Shift*. Both titles send a lowly guard to some forgotten corner of a massive research facility. Hell breaks loose as soon as the player reaches their respective destinations. Barney and the ""Marine"" must work their way to a portal to another world. They fix some critical problem in the other dimension and return to Earth for a final battle in some other forgotten corner.

That's okay. *D3* is a hard core game. It's also a hardcore system hog-with my AMD 64 FX-51 CPU, my 512MB Registered ECC RAM, and my Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB AGP the game lagged in places, particularly around doors, on the ""High Detail"" setting with 1092 x 768 res. The last few levels just killed my framerate.

Speaking of hardcore killing, *D3* is all about overkill. Beginning with the opening scene this game is just plain dark; and I don't mean subject-wise: apparently nobody has heard of floodlights in 22nd Century Mars. Id likes shadows long and deep. Id also likes blood: just about every room the character wanders into is caked in blood. That and red lights and disembodied voices form the primary chills in this game. And to rub it all in, id makes sure that enemies jump out of every nook and cranny, often teleporting all around the character while evil laughter echoes through the area.

Id's obsession with atmosphere affects gameplay. What good are shadows if the player can snag night vision goggles or a radar? That's right: the staple of many first and third person shooters is absent. Instead, the player wields a heavy flashlight which doubles as a useless club against the thick-skinned opponents. To use a gun, the player must sacrifice light. This can make self-defense rather challenging.

The old-school weapons challenge the player too. Aside from the fancy skins, the weapons might as well date from World War I. Given the anachronistic pistol with its wooden revolver grip and steel semi-automatic slide, I'm surprised the game designers didn't just go for a past/present motif all around. The ""machine gun"" sounds and behaves more like a 1920's Tommy Gun anyways. The shotgun has a semiautomatic bolt and charging handle, but operates strictly pump action. And *D3's* ""chain gun"" fires unusually slowly from a ridiculously limited ammo pool. All weapons other than the BFG 9000, the rocket launcher, and the ""soulcube"" appeared to have the same strength. Even the plasma cannon hit the same as the pistol, shotgun and machine gun.

But id's interesting design choices don't stop there. I can see why so many reviewers gripe. The gameplay consists mainly of the following formula:

1. Walk into a dark, confined room filled with flickering computer lights. Then:

a. A monster lurches out of the darkness.

b. A monster teleports into the darkness.

c. A ghost whispers something creepy.

d. A panel blows out of the floor or wall.

2. Next, walk into a dark, confined hallway filled with flickering overhead lights. Then:

a. A monster lurches out of the darkness.

b. A monster teleports into the darkness.

c. A ghost whispers something creepy.

d. A panel blows out of the floor or wall.

3. Then, walk into a dark, confined elevator filled with flickering touch-panel lights. Ride the elevator into one of the previous two locations.

Id varies this pattern with cute little horror movie scripts. Walk up to a bathroom mirror and suddenly a grainy red filter descends as laughter echoes and your reflection ages into one of the hapless zombies you kill. Walk into a control room and loose objects agitate violently, suddenly shooting across the room inches from your face. There are blood-soaked elevators with elevating body parts, skeletons that shift a few feet, bodies dangling from ceiling cables-just all kinds of nasty stuff.

Monsters included. *Doom* featured a bestiary right out of medieval Christianity. *D3* draws zoological inspiration from contemporary sci-fi horror like *Alien* and John Carpenter's *The Thing*. Id kept many of the *Doom* names, but the faces are far different, and new critters join the polygonal parade.

Little of this resembles the original and its pixilated 2D twitching-torso-on-a-stake decoration. *D3* brings a Satanic Invasion to the 3D realm (cough, cough) with an engine that sure renders light effects. Yet I can't tell much between it and *Far Cry's* Crytek engine. Id has certainly spent years crafting a grim-looking funhouse out of any Dark Castle picture. But Crytek could probably duplicate *D3* texture for bump-mapping for spectral if it wanted to. The only tech difference I detected were *D3's* totally cool computer screens clear enough to actually read, watch, and manipulate in-game.

Manipulation defines this black masterpiece. There is no multiple path option, no stealth mission, no player traps to spring.

3.0,False,"10 4, 2010",A2YAABMT80RLYA,B003Z0LFJC,Ben Rowland,"Spiderman, like all superheros, has a checkered history with video games. Some have been fantastc, such as Web of Shadows, while others have been downright abysmal. Shattered Dimensions falls somewhere in the middle, with a great story and fantastic art style being let down by gameplay issues that, at least for me, made this experience frustrating and enjoyable in equal measures.

Rather than rehash other reviews that delve into the story, I'll limit myself to saying that this is one of the best Spiderman games in terms of setting and story. I love how they have chosen different time periods, given Spiderman different abilities, and have offered a selection of challenging unlockables that will give the gamer incentive to keep playing. My personal favorite was the Noir levels, where Spiderman must stay in the shadows and use stealth to pick off his enemies. The other levels involve Spiderman webslinging and beating up enemies in a God of War/Devil May Cry style, which looks pretty but is little more than button mashing. Still, there is enough variety in the moves to allow for combos, which build up your score, but even a marginal button-masher can get through most combat situations. The real skill comes into play during boss battles, where you need to learn patterns and time your moves correctly, and especially the latter stages will see you dying a few times. It's challenging but highly addictive.

Graphically, Shattered Dimensions looks fantastic and each time period has a well-detailed and wonderfully realized sense of style. The music is also classic superhero fare and the voice acting is also quite good, more the campy style of the cartoon show as opposed to the more serious tones of the Sam Raimi movies. The dialogue is heavy on the one-liners, which sometimes are quite funny and at other times cringe-worthy, and you will sometimes find the same lines being repeated during longer boss battles. Overall, the game's style and fluid animation provide a visual experience that is sublime, especially for Spiderman fans who want something more nostalgic.

In the title of the review, I mentioned that the game is let down by the controls, and this is where I think the game really needs improvement. The controls seems to be selective about when and where they will work, and to be fair, they work well on the levels where you are webslinging across wide-open areas where little precision is required. It's the indoor locations and cramped spaces where the controls start to show their wrinkles. It is difficult to aim with precision and you'll often find yourself zipping off to a totally different area than you intended, and other times the web doesn't even shoot when you press the RT button. This is compounded by the fact that many areas are multi-leveled and require you to be accurate in order to avoid getting killed or complete objectives like rescuing civilians. Let's just say I spent a lot of time trying to land in one area and not being able to do it.

Another problem with this game is the camera, which is often your worst enemy in tight areas and during frantic combat situations. It works well for the most part, but it goes spastic when you climb a wall, hit a corner, or shoot your web in the opposite direction you are facing. It is disorienting and difficult to control, and it has resulted in me missing objectives and getting killed by enemies. This is especially cumbersome during the Noir levels. There are also quite a few glitches, most of which are forgivable, but a few that will prove frustrating. I got stuck mid-air during a web swing a few times and had to restart from my last checkpoint, which was annoying.

By the sounds of it, you might think that I didn't like this game, which is not the case. It's a good game, but I feel that it could have been an excellent game if only they had taken the time to iron out the bugs in the controls and in the camera. Other reviewers have compared this to Arkham Asylum, which is now the new gold standard in superhero games, so this game might seem like a letdown by comparison. Taken on it's own merits, this is a decent game that Spiderman fans will enjoy if they can forgive the aforementioned problems.",Great Spiderman setting brought down by poor controls,1286150400,2,"{'Edition:': ' Game with Bonus Art Concept Book', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

3.0,False,"09 21, 2008",A2SRT262WG2WH6,B0012NAXCY,Bubba_Holtzkopf,"I have been playing Madden on PSP since I bought my PSP.  That is why I bought a PSP, so I could play football any where I go.  I have been playing football since the good old days of Techmo Bowl on plain old vanilla Ninentendo.  This years Madden is just not that great.

Why do I say this?  Well, for one, the graphics aren't really that good.  The new default angle is from such a far away vantage point that you can see the whole field, but, it also makes everything looked horribly pixelated.  There is a lot some full screen anti-aliasing could do for this picture, especially when you consider how small the screen and therefore the resolution must be already.  You can change this somewhat with the ""zoom"" camera mode, but this mode makes it kind of difficult to see where your receivers are since, it drops the angle of view down to almost horizontal.  The other views either make the graphics look awful, or don't help with gameplay.

The other thing, which is similar to the NCAA 09 ""freshman mode"" is the oversimplification of this game in order to widen their market.  It was not too bad an idea with NCAA 09, but I doubt it would widen the appeal of Madden fans with a 'basic' set of controls, since it is the competitive spirit which makes you try to learn the controls and get better.  If you like to quit when you can't ""get"" a game, then you don't have the kind of competitve drive needed to be a Madden addict, and you will probably get bored with the game quickly.

Almost all other aspects of the game are the same as last year, with the exception of not turning the angle of the camera around when playing defense.  People like me have been used to your team staring off at the bottom of the screen no matter offense or defense for so long that this is just plain annoying.  I mean, it totally changes the thumb motion on the d-pad to the less natural down motion, and it makes it more difficult to judge your players position in space by having him up at the top of the screen where he the field is narrower and he is smaller.

I could understand this if the game no longer paused every time you made an interception, but it still does!  So, how does changing the angle get you more ""immersed"" into the game?  It doesn't!  It makes it more difficult, and now the game pauses a moment when you make an interception, which is lame, and it doesn't have that awe inspiring rotation of the screen, which makes things more dramatic!

Things are still clearly not immersive in the fact that you pause when you make an interception.  Rarely, in live games that I have seen do they pause the live action when that happens, therefore, this is very non immersive.  But, if they could pause the live game and rotate the screen like they do in Madden, it would be very appealing to fans watching the game.

This isn't a bad game.  The controls are different, the graphics are awful, and it lacks some of the things that made playing Madden more fun, and it is now accessible to idiots.  Sounds like something a loyal fan would just eat up, right?  Well, the sound track is better, and I like the new rosters, and the stadium graphics have improved.  Overall, this is an ok game.  They took a few small steps forward, and a few more noticble steps backward.

The only reason I am not giving it 2 stars, is the fact that I don't want to sound like one of those whiners who complain every year.  I have been quite faithful up to now, because I could see some improvement.  Now, this is getting ridiculous.

This made it a pretty good game of skill where you were challenged to hit the button at the exact right moment.

In this Mario Tennis for 3DS, that doesn't matter anymore. Sure, if you swing way too early or late, you will still miss. But as long as you press the button within the correct timing window, you will get the same result. This reduces the game to the level of Simon Says, and it's not nearly as fun in a multiplayer context, which is the only reason to play Mario Tennis.",I love Mario Tennis,1425081600,2,,

First, the fan inside the xbox was noisy from out of the box, and 2 days later the Kinect sensor died. Microsoft said they would send a new console and sensor within 2 business days, and here I am 11 days later and they JUST shipped it today. That's only after calling them every single day asking them for a status update, which was always ""we're escalating the issue and someone will get back to you within 24-48 hours"". I've never been so disappointed with Microsoft support in my entire life.

Barring hardware issues, the games are pretty great so far. The TV functions are nice, but in no way perfect. There are SO MANY features missing from this console that were available on the 360, it's absurd. But just to give a quick rundown of things I miss, and other items it should have:

-No notifications when friends come online
-No notifications when a friend starts playing the game you are playing
-No way to see recent players
-Avatars are now useless, making props and clothing you previously purchased, a total waste. Now there's no reason to spend money on that stuff.
-Viewing achievements is far too difficult and cumbersome. Can't see a list of achievements you haven't received yet.
-Near impossible to figure out how to rate a player
-Can't have a party with people who are playing different games
-No way to make TV the default when the xbox starts up, nor an IR code to force xbox into TV mode
-No way to choose auto-signin for a single profile
-No way to store universal controller configurations like southpaw and inverted Y axis
-No way to see controller batter level
-No way to easily see friends who are online without delving several menus deep
-No way to disable controller vibration
-No way to disable kinect mic by default
-Recording what you just played in a game doesn't work, always gives an error
-HDMI input is not a pass-through, which means the xbox one must ALWAYS be on to watch TV
-No way to determine headset volume level
-No way to invite player to game without also inviting player to your party
-No way to manage storage
-Xbox turns on when you plug in controller to charge (after you just turned it off)
-Bluray player doesn't support 3D bluray.
-Does not support DLNA streaming
-When TV is snapped, you can't mute just the snapped app, so you get 2 audio streams mixed together

Aside from a little scratch or two, the game plays perfectly, and just as well as I remember it in the good old days. Back when game developers focused on the structure of the game and not just the graphics or any fancy sh** like that. This was back when 90% of the games at the time were all good, simple, and had such great repetitive value. Back when the ruling mascots were Crash, Mario and Sonic. Damn, it just brings tears to my eyes I tell ya.

My only real nitpick for this product was the case it came in, the jewel case was flimsy, and the tape holding it close was not really necessary, so it broke when I tried opening it. Aside from that, I am satisfied in the long run. I recommend this seller.

[UPDATE][UPDATE][UPDATE]

A little update on the product. The game plays alright up until a certain level very close to the beginning; 'Rolling Stones' to be specific, then it just flat out freezes and sits there. This really doesn't surprise me, these games are almost 20 years old, and it is rare to find a used one in perfect condition. I'll give this one game a little extra time and try multiple times to see if the level will play.

I won't change my opinion about this seller, I am not frustrated, or anything. I got the game in a great time window, it was cheap, and it works at least. Just a little advice to anyone distributing aged games like these; I'd suggest trying to at least play these used games through and make sure they work 90% at least. Time consuming? Maybe, but in the end, the seller gets money, and the customer gets their money's worth and their satisfaction is guaranteed. Fair trade, everyone wins.

3.0,False,"03 31, 2013",A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001O4YSTU,A. Whitehead,"February 1945. Vito Scaletta returns from the war to his home city of Empire Bay. Almost immediately he finds himself drawn into a world of criminals and the mafia, as his best friend uses shady connections to get him released from the service early. As time passes Vito finds himself reaping the rewards from a life of crime...as well as the dangers.

Mafia II is the sequel to the 2002 game Mafia. Mafia is one of my favourite games of all time, with superb writing, tremendous characterisation and some fun shooting mechanics making up for occasionally questionable gameplay (such as that infamously hardcore racing mission). Mafia II is not a direct follow-up, set as it is in a different city with different characters. There are a couple of references to the events of the original Mafia, though these are obtuse enough that only hardcore fans are likely to spot them. Instead, the game's narrative is completely self-contained.

In terms of gameplay, the Mafia series resembles the Grand Theft Auto franchise with driving sections and on-foot combat, with the important difference that the Mafia games are not open-world titles. Instead you proceed directly from one mission directly to the next. This means that the cities do not need to be as exhaustively detailed and brimming with stuff to do as in the GTA titles, since they are merely backdrops to the action (though they are still well-realised). This gives the Mafia games a much greater focus and puts both their stories and characters under much more pressure, as they need to be good for the games to succeed. The GTA games, which a lot of people play purely to cause havoc in the cities without ever looking at the main storylines, don't quite have the same pressure.

This requirement paid off handsomely in the original Mafia. The story of Tommy Angelo's rise from taxi driver to criminal fixer, becoming a made man and gaining a family and respectability before realising how brutal and violent his world had become, was extremely compelling. It featured musings on the corrosive effects of violence on the psyche and on the morality of killing. It was a stronger story than anything to appear in a GTA title (and, interestingly, GTA4 seemed to take more than a few ideas from it).

Unfortunately, it does not pay off in Mafia II. Illusion Softworks - now 2K Czech - were obviously keen not to repeat themselves in this game, so Vito Scaletta's story is rather different to Tommy's. It unfolds over a much shorter span of time (limited to two periods of several months in 1945 and 1951) and is less of the traditional rags-to-riches tale. Vito is a small-time hood who pretty much stays a small-time hood (albeit one who eventually gets a rather nice house) throughout. He doesn't have a relationship or get married, and in fact seems to be rather more sexist than Tommy (the lack of any healthy female relationships in his life and his obsession with collecting Playboy magazines indicates such). He's also a lot dumber, frequently agreeing to shady deals that have, ""THIS IS GOING TO GO BADLY WRONG,"" written all over them.

This in itself is a problem, with Vito's misadventures being less compelling than either Tommy's in the earlier game, or the protagonists of most of the GTA games. A bigger problem is the lack of decent other characters. Aside from Vito's best buddy Joe, none of the other characters in the game gets much of a personality, or motivation. Even keeping track of which criminal is working for which gang is hard work. There is little to no emotional investment in Vito, his story, or in the other characters, which does interfere with caring about the game.

Fortunately, the gameplay is still pretty good. It's similar to Mafia's and the gunplay is even better, helped by that rarest of beasts, a cover system which actually works and adds to the combat experience. There's one oddity in that Mafia limited you to one of each class of weapon whilst Mafia II allows you to carry every weapon at once, making it a rare example of a game that actually gives the player more choice rather than taking it away through limited arsenals. This is a welcome move. Driving is also similar, with the game still being rather less forgiving about things like running red lights, speeding or hit-and-runs than the GTA series. The cops are harder to shake this time around, but you also have more options for losing them, including running into clothes shops to change clothes or offering bribes. The missions are also quite long, with mid-mission checkpoints and a number of plot twists that, whilst usually predictable, keep things ticking over. The graphics are very impressive (especially the lighting; Mafia II may have the best sunrises and sunsets of any game to date, and the way car headlights diffuse in the fog is extremely atmospheric) and the soundtrack is first-rate, with some great (if occasionally anachronistic) tracks from the birth of the rock 'n' roll era.

Ultimately, Mafia II is a far less compelling game than its forebear due to the weaker writing, story and characters. This is annoying as the gameplay is often better, but you have much less reason to care about what's going on. The game is also stingier, with combat sections often being extremely brief and easy. Mafia II has most of the same ingredients as its excellent forebear, but this time around they do not combine into as compelling a game.","Solid gameplay, but the story and characters are poor compared to the original",1364688000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Sadly, that's about where it stops. I won't go too much into detail in regards to the gameplay (Youtube can do a much better job) but instead would like to discuss the pros and cons of this game, and finally tell you whether I would recommend spending money on it. I downloaded this on the Xbox Marketplace, but from what I have seen the Xbox and PC versions are identical.

PROS
- Beautiful, indie-looking environment. HDR is fantastic!
- A rather unique concept and gameplay
- It has parkour/assassin's creed-type climbing and movements
- Realistic down to how many bullets you find and can use
- Provides a decent amount of challenge, both in terms of gaming skill and cerebrally-speaking.

CONS
- VERY linear. Almost no straying from set line, and if you do, you're going to get sick of dead-end alleys.
- You can only save at checkpoints. I hate this in ANY game, but is of note for I Am Alive because gameplay can be mundane enough that I do NOT want to go back to a checkpoint to save.
- As mentioned above, some of the gameplay can become quite mundane, especially if you make a mistake and have to backtrack/restart.
- The game has crashed on me several times, see above ad nauseum.
- 3rd Person perspective is difficult coming from FPS (not considered in my rating, just a personal note)

Really, it comes down to your expectations. Coming from fast-paced, heavily crowded apocalyptic games such as L4D, the game seems a little too casual to me. I don't always need a million things to look at, but the combination of long video sequences and having to backtrack if you mess up, really pushes this game over the edge of playable for me. I think a more dynamic environment, possibly a little bit more open world, really would have opened this game up. I don't mind climbing up a building to find nothing on top of it, as long as I have CHOSEN to climb that building, you know? I play many different types of game; RPG, FPS, strategy and they all have one thing in common: the ability to chose HOW you want to play the game.

This isn't the post-apocalyptic, lone-survivor game I was hoping it would be, and in that respect I can't really recommend it. You may enjoy it, but I certainly feel as though there is a lot that can be improved upon.

OK, I went to Corpus Christi and started trading with that town, because before you can build anything in a town, you need a building permit, and before you can buy a building permit, you have to impress the locals by delivering a ton of goods.  I spent most of my allotted time currying favor with Corpus Christi, until finally I had enough merit to buy a building permit--only to be told that my rank was not high enough to have more than three building permits in the Caribbean, and I already had three.

The game has some good ideas: the various characters and helpers (""Pixls"") have diverse abilities, and many situations require the player to make intelligent choices about which character/helper combination to use.  This installment of the series does away with turn-based battles in favor of what is basically  platforming gameplay with RPG elements (e.g., hit points and levels), and the integration is surprisingly smooth.

The fun factor takes a dive, though, as too many areas feature lengthy backtracking and counterintuitive or arbitrary puzzle solutions.  The game often presents puzzles without the slightest hint of what to do with them--or it uses the environment inconsistently; for example, boxes that normally turn only red or blue suddenly also turn orange and black--but only in one specific part of the game, and with no warning.  Super Paper Mario's gameplay is relatively easy, but its often opaque puzzles can quickly make it frustrating.

On a different note, the game's English translation sparkles, with distinct and often hilarious dialogue for each character--a good thing, since this must be one of the talkiest Mario titles ever.  The dialogue is packed with winking references and sly send-ups of other Nintendo games that should delight long-time fans.  Unfortunately, the story proper is completely predictable, if unusually dark for a Mario game.  There are also hundreds of collectibles in several categories (Recipes, Catch Cards, Maps), but the unappealing gameplay gives scant motivation for extra scrounging after the main story is over.

I like sound that has good deep bass and clear sound. The 500's did NOT do this for me... Seriously, I've learned a very important lesson when it comes to gaming headphones that NO one tells you about (Because the average gamer doesn't know).... Gaming headphones and virtual surround are made for gamers who 'NEED' to hear footsteps coming up from behind them.

Saying that, most gaming headsets in virtual sound will mute or dumb down bass or environmental sound so you can hear things like footsteps very, very clear. Here's what I learned on my third pair of headphones... IF you aren't a FPS gamer and play all sorts of games, get a amplified stereo headset and save yourself a $100 or so dollars. 7.1 / 5.1 and all those gaming presets are for FPS gamers. I say this because I ended up going back to my TB X12's which are $40, I've had them for 5 years and the bass and treble are really well balanced and the bass rumbles in my ears. I went back and forth testing the X12's compared to the Gold's and 500s and I couldn't deny the difference AND they are only $40.

SO, as of yesterday I returned my 500's to Amazon and I'm getting the PX24's. This advice I'm giving is coming from someone who plays a lot of different types of games, I don't need to specifically hear footsteps, I want good low rumbling bass and want to hear the heaviness of a gunshot or engine. Don't bother with the expensive surround headphones, they are all hyped. Most people review these and rave about them because they've never owned any other type of pair or compared them to several headphones. They don't know any better.

My wife was laughing while I was testing the 500's because I kept yelling, ""HOW DOES A $40 X12 Headset beat a $100 7.1 surround set??"" It was frustrating because I wanted the 500s to work but for now on I'm sticking to the cheaper ones and getting better sound. Side note, I just bought No Man's Sky and used that game and Just Cause 3 to test the sound on the headphones. The 500's drowned out the phasers and engines. I ended up skipping the surround sound altogether and sticking with the 'Bass & Tremble' setting... WHICH IS essentially the X12's and Px24's.  I also threw in GTAV and Metal Gear Solid V.  Same results.

Also, just to point out, the Gold Wireless lacked any bass whatsoever.  I was shocked but then discovered that the reason for no bass is the reason the 500's sucked...  It dulls / plays down a lot of atmospheric / environmental sounds including gun shots, etc...  This is to give the playing a major edge in FPS so they can hear footsteps, clips reloading, etc.  ONE more time, if you aren't a FPS fanatic and don't care if you hear footsteps coming up behind you, get cheaper amplified headphones.  Even with the X12's I could get somewhat surround but it keeps all the sounds at a full level and balanced.  Just frusturuing because most reviewers don't know this and take it for what it's worth.","I've owned the x12's, PS Gold's and the 500p's.  Ended up going back to the X12's.

In Shadow Hearts 3, none of these were back and it just turned the series into a blend and sometimes annoying game.

The main characters are not likable right from the beginning. Johnny, a sixteen year old private detective who happens to be for God's sake amnesia. The character design is exacltly the same as the character in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Final Fantasy XII. Shania just lack the death of Kirin in Covenant and not to mention all the other characters who joined the team randomly. The story is scattered all over the place to fit into the world of randomness of the characters. Seriously the most interesting characters in the game are Lady and Killer. The giant cat Mao is annoying, the Ninja is easily the most hateable character competing with Hilda the vampire. The seriously lack of depth for the characters already killed half of the game, not to mention the lack of substance in the story. In Covenant, the side quests naturally blends into the story as they were mentioned here and there even before they were opened up for you to tackle them. In 3, they were just there for the sake of being there. Nothing interesting and nothing exciting, and Johnny's sidequest is just damn annoying, comparable to Kurando's sidequest in Covenant.

The battle system is greatly improved in a way that you need to be more strategic than just go all out and whack. But when your enemies also took advantage of the system, it could leave you breaking the controller into two with tears, and prepare for that in Johnny's sidequest. The battle system is very interesting and strategic with customisable rings, double-attack, combos etc. There are more gauges and stats you need to pay attention to during the battle. It could definitely satisfy players who want to have more interactive and intuitively strategic battle system. However, Shania has less fusion forms compared to Yuri and her fusion for most of the time look like porns - from tatoos on various parts of her body, including all the private parts. These tatoos light up and there will be a close up on them. It is very disappointing that From the New World needs to use that kind of tactic to attract players. For all other characters, most of their moves are mediocre though Hilda the vampire's certain moves could be lifesaving in important and difficult battles.

In all Shadow Hearts 3 is a game that you can play if you are free and once finished, there is nothing interesting to revisit it in the future. Unlike Covenant, it is not a game that you can get yourself addicted to and replay it again and again.",Not as good as Covenant,1146268800,22,,

3.0,True,"05 21, 2008",A14NA0W8ESGDSI,B000QW9D14,T.L.,"One of the first things you'll notice as you begin to play Blue Dragon is that the game's story revolves around a simple good versus evil dichotomy with little variation in character outlook from that. The good characters are sickly good and the evil characters are deviously evil --- there are no characters with real depth. It's for this reason I find it hard to see in any of the characters human characteristics or relate to any of them.

The models as well are childish in nature and make the characters (which the manual states are in their late teens) look like they're all under the age of 10.

The plot from the very beginning is also easy to read and lacks any sort of depth or any form of twist to keep the player engaged. It's like reading a story after reading a summary of the plot --- you just don't find yourself surprised when something happens because you knew it was going to happen. If an RPG doesn't shake your worldview in the slightest I consider it a complete failure.

As for the great mechanics I mentioned in my title --- I found the game design to be wonderful despite it's flaws with an actual story. The usage of the charge bar keeps the user engaged and I found the enemies to level up progressively at a reasonable pace similar to your own growth so it kept things somewhat enjoyable. The idea behind making random encounters random but allowing the user to attack them was also very cool (Secret of Mana style meets Final Fantasy < 12 JRPG battle system sort of thing).

The real problem with the mechanics, however wonderful, is that it's very very very easy to get higher levels simply because the enemies tend to be plentiful but easy to kill in one or two rounds from the start on once you've gained any sort of advantage. Your fighters will have mow down techniques which hit the whole first row for nearly the life of the enemy which could easily allow you to rack up experience points if that was your intention.

Quickly want to mention the shadow system. It allows users to attach a different class to their shadow to gain skills which can be set to other shadow classes they use. To put it simply I level up my black magic class and get the ability to use black magic level 1 spells on my fighter class by assigning it the skill I learned. The classes all have their own stats so it does have variations in terms of attack power in or out of the class but as others have mentioned can also allow you to create 5 distinct clones of each character with little trouble. I didn't, however, and found the system to be fun so it's really whether or not you take advantage of the system which will affect you in that regards. It could have been made better though, I agree, and more class selections would have given a more unique feel to the process as well.

Music was wonderful though and the graphics were pretty despite its cartoon feel. In general it's a good game and had the story been even somewhat decent would have been an unforgettable JRPG.",Great Mechanics with Horrid Story,1211328000,4,,

Design-wise I'd say this is perhaps the best mouse I've ever used, not too big, yet wide enough to not allow the pinky and thumb to curl into a ball-shape which I've found my hand doing on narrower mice. The grip, materials, buttons, and overall shape feel just about perfect.

Regardless of the cryptic and difficult Corsair software that runs this mouse I was prepared to write a 5-star review for this mouse after unboxing and testing it. Unfortunately after a single re-boot of my computer the Corsair Utility Engine failed to detect the mouse. Fortunately this mouse works without any Corsair software installed with 5 available DPI levels and a working sniper button.

To those who are tech savvy the above problem can be fixed by installing a 3rd party app called Startup Delayer by r2 Studios, and doing so was simple. Adding the Corsair Utility Engine to this app with a delay value as low as 0 seemed to work! CUE then properly detects the mouse after a reboot.

Hopefully this means patching the problem will be a simple matter, but until Corsair patches this issue people might buy this then have the CUE software fail to detect their device after a reboot, making it difficult to recommend at this time, at this price.

3.0,False,"11 15, 2007",A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B000U88UVS,Mike,"I will admit that I had faith in Tilted Mill for taking the huge task of blending Simcity and The Sims together into Simcity Societies. After all they did a nice job in Children of the Nile. It wasn't a ""blow me out of the water"" hit, but it was nice.

Tilted Mill and Electronic Arts decided to bring Simcity Societies in which everything from Simcity 4000 and its expansion are thrown out the door and reworked. This was a bold plan considering how hugely popular the Simcity franchise has been. From the original to Simcity 4000, the core of the game remained the same. The graphics began to change and content was added. This ranged from city ordinances, one-way streets, ground highways, above ground highways, sanitation, ferries, and elevated highways. Simcity in effect evolved. While not perfect in Simcity 4000, it certainly was a beauty to look at in 3D (somewhat). With the added expansion Rush Hour, it certainly made SC4k more enjoyable and more content.

Here's were Simcity Societies tries to continue the Simcity franchise yet retools everything starting with the original Simcity more than 18 years ago. Instead of zoning, you place the buildings just like in City Life. Unlike in SC4K, roads and power has been watered down. No power lines can be placed. Schools, colleges, museums and libraries have been totaly changed. You can create different types of cities by placing specific buildings. If you place more courts, jails, and police stations, your city becomes Orwellian. You can create a ""creative"" city using murals and other buildings specific to creativity. Also you can create an Industrious city. These are a few types of cities you can create. This is disapointing to me because I loved the zoning and the micromanagement that came along with the Simcity Franchise. You cant even drive in your city. All of this was wiped out in Simcity Societies. Not good! This I would believe would alienate many Simcity lovers. After playing Rush Hour, I was hoping EA wouldn't abandon SC4K like Atari/Frontier abandoned Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. SC4K and Rush Hour Expansion just needed some minor tweaking, more content, updated graphics and it would put SC4K even higher. Perhaps next to The Sims Franchise and Civilization.

The graphics are nice. If these graphics were used in SC4K, then I would have to say is, WOW! Unfortunately, EA/TM didn't. Everyone said this is a hybrid of The Sims and Simcity but I would have to add City Life into it. Simcity Societies is a mix of The Sims, Simcity, and City Life. From City Life, the only thing missing are the social classes that can't get along and mix in turn create trouble that you have to deal with. City Life tried to be the successor to Simcity as Simcity Societies tried to as well. Unfortunately, both failed. The developers had good ideas but there was too much watering down. SimCity Societies was a good attempt but not good enough. Maybe Tilted Mill will listen and restore what made the Simcity Franhise a terrific city-management game.

One thing that surprised me. Im running this game on a Intel Core2Duo machine, with 4GB ram, x1900xtx video card, SB X-Fi and it hick-ups at times.

Im not going to go as far as saying steer clear of this game. It had good promise and it seemed like Tilted Mill was really trying unlike other developers who send out horrible games and then distant themselves from it, or blame the dog. Simcity lovers will pick up this game, then be somewhat disapointed. Newcomers to the citybuilding genre will like it, then as they get further into the game, will see it as fading on the fun and wow factor. I bought it when it first was released simply because I had a giftcard when I traded in some console games. Otherwise I would of waited for the price to go down. I still enjoy SC4K and Im in the middle of building a huge region. Simcity Societies doesnt make me forget SC4k. But again, I hope Tilted Mill retinkers Simcity Societies and restores what made SC4k a great game. Together they will make a masterpiece. Until then, I will hope and pray.

Please becareful as well. Those bargain $200-$800 will not run Simcity Societies. Pay close attention to the requirements. If you are running the onboard graphics and/or sound graphics the game will not work.

Those itching to try this, I encourage you to download the demo first. Those that are still undecided, wait for the expansion Destinations (which looks promising) to be released, and make up your mind then. By then, the Deluxe will be available (end of May to late June) which includes all of the Simcity games from the original to Simcitiy Societies and its expansion.

Which doesn't make sense, because it uses shots from the game! How is it that playing the game looks better than the intro? The tracks aren't really anything special. Though I have to admit I have yet to see another car racing game with tracks full of places to do stunts.
Controls - Very smooth. No problems here.
Sound - Excellent. Cars have slightly different motor sounds, which you probably won't be paying attention to while you're racing, though. The announcer never seems to get annoying, even though after a while you've heard everything he says at least once. The music is okay, but once again, you won't be paying much attention to it either.
Gameplay - The main area where the game falls apart. For several reasons. For one, you HAVE TO have a friend to play this game with you while doing the championships and try to get the top two or three spots every race. Because the computer cheats, even on the easiest setting (forgiving) and especially when you start hitting the Elite class races. You need to get the top spots so the CPU can't win the gold, because if one of you doesn't doesn't get gold you can't advance to the next championship.
How does the CPU cheat? It seems to have unlimited turbos and unlimited traction power ups that it can seem to activate at will to counter the effects of other power ups and zoom ahead of you. Freeze, the ice power up that affect a cars handling ability will sometimes have no effect on them if they get hit with it, while it can end up getting you completely turned around and crashed into a wall. Plus the CPU seems to be able to take all the corners, turns and shortcuts perfectly. At the beginning it doesn't even use the shortcuts, but later it uses all of them and knows which ones to use to get better lap times.
Once you do manage to get gold in the championships, you will unlock one new car, and one new track. However, this unlocks only half the cars, as you will have to find a hidden egg on each track to unlock the other cars. Had I known this when I first played it, I wouldn't have been so pissed off the first time I played through the game. Because when I had finished nearly all the championships I still hadn't unlocked all the cars. Plus to begin with, most of the cars you do unlock are worthless. The only cars that have decent handling are Tiberius and Silver Streak. Don't even bother touching the other cars, not even the Cataclysm, though it has the same stats as the two I mentioned, since you will notice a difference in how the car handles. Which makes this game's cheating more evident, as it can seem to propel cars that have sublimely awful stats and handling to the top spots, since I've seen cars like The Banger place second.
Replay Value - Almost non-existent. For one, the game is a pain in the ass to play through because of the cheapness and cheating of the computer. You'll never get the best lap times, so being able to race the tracks with your friend for fun to see who can get the best records has been ruined. The top scores for total race time and lap time for each track are IMPOSSIBLE to break! So are the scores on the stunt mode. Who the hell set these records, they have to be manufactured (meaning I think they were just typed in) because you don't have a hope in hell of ever touching them. So once you've unlocked all the cars and all the tracks, there isn't much to do. Like I mentioned before, 90% of the cars aren't even worth unlocking in the first place.

It's not so much that this is a bad game by any means, but rather that it's not the type of ""Giant open-world MMORPG"" or anything else that it's been promoted as.  At best, this game is a 1-3 player co-op shooter game with optional deathmatch mode.

The lack of day 1 reviews on this game I believe have nothing to do with the fact that this game is so huge (it isn't) or that you need players for it to work (you don't) but rather that the developers know this game is going to get hammered in the ratings and want their pre-orders filled first before people flock to gamestop to drop their copy off for $5-$10.

But freedom comes at a price. Superman: Shadow of Apokolips is the first of its kind to allow you to play Superman with all of his abilities and in a fully rendered three-dimensional environment, but there are clipping errors and strange forced perspectives that ultimately dampen the game's enjoyment.

The plot is a loosely connected series of events involving the extra dimensional arch villain, Apokolips. Through his minion, Canto, he sets up a series of military-style attacks with ""Apokoliptian technology"" that he provides to Lex Luthor. Lex eventually sets a series of super villains free from Stryker Prison, including Livewire, Parasite, and Metallo. Or just Metallo's head in this case.

Lex is provided with a cadre of Interbots, strange goggle-eyed guys in masks. But don't worry, they're robots, so Superman can punch them without any gore. I was willing to accept the old G.I. Joe chestnut (i.e., ""we have powerful guns, but let's run up to the bad guys and smash them in the face with our rifle butts!"").

Punching Interbots is decidedly unsatisfying. Killing Interbots can be amusing at first. Setting them on fire with heat vision causes them to run around, arms flailing. They will sometimes run away, screaming in mechanical voices ""This unit is compromised"" or something like that. And yet, there's no feeling of Superman's awesome strength. When he hits Interbots, I want to see them go through walls, not just bounce around like rag dolls.

And there are so MANY of them. Superman fights Interbots, Interbot tanks, Interbot missle launchers, Interbot troop transports, Interbot gun emplacements, Interbots with jet packs, and Interbot helicopters. I don't ever recall seeing this many Interbots in the Superman cartoon.

Because of the sheer number of opponents, certain tactics are encouraged over others. Superman has a wide variety of abilities, including his x-ray vision, heat vision, super breath, super speed, flight, and super strength. But his best ability is an area attack slam that drops him at high speed onto the ground, knocking back and destroying everything in sight. This ability was more useful than punching Interbots. So suddenly, Superman becomes a living torpedo. Not necessarily a bad thing, but hardly representative of the Superman cartoon.

The game looks exactly like the movie, rendered in cell-shaded animation. All the voices actors are present, including Lori Petty as Livewire and Malcom McDowell as Metallo. But even those villains aren't the type who can go punch for punch with Superman.

Of all of the villains, only Livewire can fly. Superman slowly regenerates his damage and his super abilities. This means that if he is significantly harmed, you can just fly him away to a safe place and heal there. When fighting Metallo, I did this several times, while Metallo patiently waited down on the ground.

But I don't want to put the game down entirely. The game's plot is entertaining and even has a few twists. When the villains do show up, they are fully realized. I had a difficult time beating Livewire so I had plenty of opportunities to hear her wax poetic about electricity. I can't stand Lori Petty (except for her role in Tank Girl), but she really does act her heart out mocking Superman. Metallo does the same thing. There's a lot of entertainment value in just listening to them mock Superman. Superman returns the favor by talking to himself. Over and over and over. It gets annoying.

In terms of gameplay, there are a few high points. Superman must achieve the random feat of strength - plugging a damn, struggling through a wind tunnel. The game represents these challenges by requiring the player to tap a button repeatedly. Sadly, that mechanic isn't used enough.

The parts of the game that were most challenging (and sometimes frustrating) are the timed events. In essence, Superman must run an obstacle course before time runs out. If he fails...the screen goes white.

OH NO, SUPERMAN MUST BE DEAD!

Ahem. Given that Superman is near immortal, it's difficult to comprehend losing the game because, say, he didn't successful stave off a wind tunnel. So what? Superman would probably end up destroying the fan behind him without a scratch on him. Batman's mortality is precisely what raises the stakes - in Superman, it's hard to feel a sense of urgency for a man of steel.

At one point, Lex releases Metallo and encourages him to go after Superman. But Metallo, a cyborg, was originally created by Lex Luthor and ultimately betrayed by him by removing Metallo's head from his body. The first order of business for Metallo is to go after Lex.

The best part of the game is when Metallo shows up at Lex's office.

LEX: ""Hello, Metallo. I was expecting to you.""
METALLO: ""Good, now stand right still while I remove YOUR head from YOUR body.""
LEX: ""Mercy?""

Lex nods towards Mercy, his female bodyguard who is carrying a large machinegun.

METALLO: ""Not even if you beg.""
LEX: ""No you idiot, I mean her, behind you.""
METALLO: ""Do you seriously think I'm going to fall for-""

And that's when Mercy cuts loose with her machinegun, inflicting absolutely no damage whatsoever to Metallo. Unfortunately, Superman steps in at that point. It's telling that the best part of the game is a cut scene.

The game is extremely simple, operatable and probably comprehendable by a 5- or 6-year-old. You basically use the directional pad and a little speed burst button. The premise pretty much follows the movie, and you spend most of the game traversing the ocean.
The game took about 15 minutes to master, in terms of control, particularly with the change from side to front-and-back views in an annoyingly long sequence where you must chase Dory, the blue fish who helps you accomplish the title. You have to direct Nemo's father against or with the current, making sure to avoid bumping into crabs, blowfish, or other monstrous sea creatures.

Finally being in control of Kain again after all this time was quite a pleasure, but unfortunately, the game is not all its cracked up to be...
First off, the gameplay is strictly mediocre. Soul Reaver veterans will recognize the mechanics right away. Unfortunately, it seems the problems of the Soul Reaver games have come over as well. This game focuses more on combat than anything else, and is designed as such. However, given that the game is loosely a Soul Reaver clone, you'll find yourself wanting to avoid combat more than actually throwing yourself into it. Unfortunately, the game's central focus is combat, and successful progression in the game is based on your ability to fight. A pity, because the problems begin there.
Enemies, just like in Soul Reaver 2, are always better fighters, with many more attacks than Kain, and a plethora of unblockable moves. You may find yourself outnumbered, and while you can easily handle your enemies if you're good, Kain will probably just end up on the ground, and you'll be shaking your head in frustration. And once again, the ATROCIOUS auto-targeting system of Soul Reaver 2 has returned. When you auto-fix on an enemy, all it takes is a sidestep, and you'll have Kain hacking away in the opposite direction while the enemy charges up his unblockable attack or unleashes his own combo on you.
'Stealth Kills', like in such games as Tenchu, are probably one of the better parts of combat, but serve little purpose.  The only time a 'stealth kill' can be performed is if there is mist on the ground.  Even if you sneak up on an enemy without mist on the ground, you cannot perform a 'stealth kill', which makes stealth kills utterly useless and just forces more of the mediocre combat on you.
Collision detection is pretty awful. In fact, it seems to be 2-d, shown in the simple fact that you cannot seem to jump over enemies. If you are standing in front of an enemy, although you clearly jump higher than his head level, you cannot jump OVER him, thus making you an easy aerial target. Also, your weapon seems to pass through enemies more than it hits them, leaving you as an open target yet again.
Sound is strange...often times, ambient sound that is completely inappropriate for the moment(such as the blood guzzling sound) begins to play out of nowhere during cutscenes. The sound is so loud that it drowns out the voice-overs, effectively ruining whatever story element there is(and there isn't much). There are also many other glitches in the game that are just too glaring to be overlooked.
Story.....all the games in the past had a great, involving story. This game lacks the gripping story element of the previous games, which is why even die-hard LoK fans may overlook this game. What little story there is gets expressed through small cutscenes, which could basically be considered 'Mission Briefings' as opposed to story progression. Sometimes there are cut-scenes during the mission which convey the story rather well, but overall, the strongest element of the previous games is very weak in this game.
The bottom line: Only Die-Hard LoK fans will enjoy this game, and even as such may find the game to be bland, devoid of story and interesting gameplay. By today's standards, this game is mediocre in every sense of the word. Gamers who are not knowledgeable about the LoK series will definitely want to avoid this game all together, and LoK/SR fans also may want to avoid this game due to lack of story and good gameplay. Being a diehard LoK fan, I found the game remotely enjoyable, but the game simply gets too repetitive as it goes on.

3.0,False,"03 11, 2001",A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00004U8KC,Marc Ruby&amp;#8482;,"Riddle of the Sphinx is a classic puzzle game that draws its theme from many of the New Age, Atlantean and alien invasion versions of human history.  Sort of a blend of Indiana Jones and the X Files.  It is set at the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx in contemporary Egypt.  As indicated this is, like many Dreamcatcher games, a puzzle game, not a true adventure.  As such the action is limited to running back and forth in order to find clues and complete puzzles.
It is a difficult game to evaluate fairly.  It is the product of a small team (two to be exact) that literally worked out of their house.  As such it represents a remarkable effort.  Unfortunately, like many games from Dreamcatcher, there is little cause for excitement.  When compared to a game developed by a full team - such as Ultima IX or The Longest Journey, these efforts come off very badly.
One has to keep in mind that Dreamcatcher sells these games for considerably less than its bigger brothers.  The truth is that ROTS is almost a very good game.  It does have several flaws.  First of all, it is not clear what your real object is until the end of the game.  It turns out that this is intentional, but it leaves you feeling a bit at a loss when you are trying to make sense of the clues.  Another problem is the somewhat unorthodox user interface.  I was perpetually hitting the wrong key.  This will take a bit of getting used to.
The scenery is very pseudo-Egyptian, but doesn't really ring true.  It is the source of several of the irritating inconsistencies in the game as well.  Finally, there is a hint book for sale.  It seems that every time game designers market a hint book as well as the game, they view this as a license to create puzzles that are hard to virtually impossible (It sells hint books, after all).  This turns a reasonable priced game into a purchase of questionable value.
This is really a 3.5 star game, but I cannot in all conscience give it the benefit of the doubt and round up to a four.  Even so, the designers display a good bit of talent.  Hopefully future efforts will benefit from there initial experiences.",Almost a Success,984268800,31,,

I liked waving the Wii remote to do the moves. Unfortunately for me, that has been completely stripped out in favor of button mashing. I hated the control scheme of 2010 when I started playing, but I'm warming up to it a little. The problem I have with this game is that some matches are incredibly difficult to win. For instance, I played a cage match for almost a half-hour because I couldn't get the opponent to stay on the ground long enough to climb out. I must've done 6 or 7 finishers and I still couldn't get out fast enough.

Side note: You can use virtual console controllers or Gamecube controllers with this game if you prefer not to use the Wii remote (since there are no motion controls anyway).

U rekindled my faith in the New Super Mario branch of the franchise with its strong level design and fresh-enough content for a sequel that the 3DS entry wishes it had. This particular installment in the lineup was made for this purpose - To highlight the 20th Anniversary of Luigi. And with that in mind, you'd think Nintendo would make this one even fresher, providing some all-new worlds and environments ideal for Luigi and his abilities helping it give off a unique and interesting experience

Oooor it could just be a merely smaller clone/rehash of New Super Mario Bros. U............

Unfortunately, we're given the latter. Everything you've seen in NSMBU is present and accounted for, including the worlds, bosses, etc. You even get the same cutscenes and sequences on the maps! NOTHING was changed....except for the level design...and Luigi's usual characteristics (higher jumping, slightly floatier) have been implemented.

For whatever reason, the levels are all made much shorter ON PURPOSE. The maximum time limit is always 100 seconds, so you're always pressured to breeze through the pint-sized levels, not being able to take the time to establish any actual fondness or appreciation of the levels themselves. Even then, the levels are not quite as up to snuff as in other NSMB games, with the exception of maybe NSMB2. At least they provide a challenge....

...Unless you decide to play as that Nabbit character, as I like to call him, ""Easy Mode: The Character"". When playing as Nabbit, you can collect power-ups as extra lives, and not take damage from ANY enemy, including bosses. This wipes out any challenge presented in the game, and although playing as him is optional, the fact that he's playable ruins the entire point of this game's confused structure.

Yes, I completely get it: This is simply DLC for the real NSMBU. However, having it sell for $20, and then releasing the game alone as a RETAIL TITLE FOR $10 MORE makes the game hard to swallow, especially considering the time gap between this and NSMBU - The latter was released on November 2012, correct? Nintendo had around SEVEN MONTHS (NINE if you count the retail release!) to conceptualize the project, and after that amount of time, it just comes off as a giant missed opportunity to make a great new 2D platformer based solely around Luigi.

Despite all that's said, though, there's still at least some fun to be had. The classic 2D Mario formula is still alive and kicking, and New Super Mario Bros. U is a great title, so of course New Super Luigi U is bound to retain some things that made NSMBU a good play. It's just a shame the effort feels overall lazy, and there's so, so, so much more that could have been done.

For each mission you select one handgun, rifle and shotgun.  There are only 3 varieties of each.  You must play the missions in a specified order.  There were only a couple that were optional.  You can reset the keyboard controls.  (I changed Jump to Spacebar and Crouch to Shift)  You can't manually save the game.  It automatically saves when you complete a mission.  There usually is another save just before you confront the ""big boss"" in each mission.  Some missions are quite long so it is annoying to get killed and have to start all over from the beginning.

The best thing for me was the theme.  It is nice to get a break from the typical zombies and goblins.  The various missions take place in a wide variety of settings:
towns, RR yards, graveyards, mines, woods, a fort, etc.  A couple were on horseback.
(you didn't control the horse though - it ran as if on rails)  The best one was on a moving train.

3.0,False,"12 3, 2008",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B0012N3T3Y,Raul G.,"Resistance 2 comes as somewhat of a disappointment to me. I absolutely loved the first Resistance game for the PS3 and it was truly the first ""must have"" title for the system.

Unfortunately many of the things that endeared me to the first game have been modified or dropped completely in R2. The excellent narration between levels featured in the first game is now completely gone and sorely missed.  The story suffers because of it. Now instead of getting a quick update of the fight against the Chimera the game relies on in-game voice acting to move the story. It simply doesn't work for me. The objectives are never quite clear enough, the motivation isn't quite there. I felt like every level was simplified to ""kill the guys who don't look like us"". Very disappointing considering the first game had such an excellent story.

Another disappointment to me is the graphics. While R2 does add more colors to the originals palette the game is by no means stunning. Graphical glitches are prevalent in everything from evident polygon seams to areas completely missing textures. The environment textures themselves vary from pixilated to blurry. This all stands in stark contrast to in-game bosses which are stunning. The graphical detail from level to level is also uneven. The very first level looks terrible while the next level, situated in a redwood forest, looks great. I can't help but feel that the game could've used another 6 months in development to improve the graphics.

Also cut are the fun vehicle sequences from R1. That's right you won't get a crack to pilot any vehicle of any type at any point in the game. Co-operative offline campaign has also been cut and replaced with random levels that feature no story to speak of. Very disappointing.

Another change to R2 is the weapons themselves. The first game featured a large variety of weapons that were added to the player's inventory permanently. Now, not only has the amount of weapons offered dwindled; but you can only carry 2 weapons at one time. I can understand certain players citing more realism as the reason for the change but it simply doesn't make sense - Resistance isn't about realism.

Changes too have been made to the health system. In the first game the player had a traditional health bar that provided the pertinent information. That has now been removed in favor of a damage system represented by a red screen. The more damage your character takes the more red the outer ring of your screen will become. I don't have a problem with the new system as much as I have a problem with the one-hit instant kills that have been added to the game. Certain enemies retain the capability of stopping you dead in your tracks. Unfortunately this is abused by the developer and you'll find yourself randomly dying at the hands of enemies in what can only be described as trial and error. It's very frustrating to be killed unexpectedly because you're unclear where to go or what to do or by invisible enemies.

One change to the game that I liked is the inclusion of a cast of characters that Nathan actually fights alongside. The first Resistance game was essentially a one man show. While in R2 you have no direct control of your squad-mates they are there and fight along with you. The AI for these characters is moderately capable.

The online portion of the game has clearly received more attention in R2. You now have a slew of options including cooperative and competitive online modes. A big selling point touted by the developer is the ability to fight in 60-player online battles. My experience thus far has been mixed. The massive battles I've played in are unorganized and chaotic. I confess that thus far I'm not a fan. The game attempts to encourage small squad based objectives but it hasn't had the desired effect. In online games I've started it seems that my squad immediately fragments into individuals.

Ultimately, Resistance 2 will probably be liked more by newcomers to the series. Fans of the original game will likely notice the shortcomings and changes all to well. Still, R2 is a proficient enough of an effort and here's hoping the next game realigns with the efforts of the first.","Inferior to the Original, But Still Good",1228262400,106,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Secondarily, the game just isn't very deep, but I'll get to that a little later.

Realistically, it seems impossible that a virtue like a well balanced characters set would be ignored or mishandled to the extent that it is, but alas, this is the case.  This major flaw has a debilitating twin effect.  1)  As an online player, you'll find yourself running into the same overused characters constantly: Ryu, Sagat, Ken, Zangief.  This is somewhat understandable since these are easily the best characters in the game (even among these top tier characters, Ryu and Sagat stand out as clearly better than the rest).  This means if you don't enjoy playing one of these characters, you can expect a losing record against them all.  Sorry, but if you're in a Beamer, you're not going to beat a guy in a Ferrari.  So, in playing with a lesser character, you'll struggle to improve, tighten up your game, and eventually come to the frustrating realization that because of your character's built-in weaknesses and/or highly context specific move-set, you'll often come up against another player of similar or equal skill who uses a better character.  2) For players not choosing these characters, you're then faced with two bad choices: picking a character you like and losing consistently to the game's overpowered characters, or choosing one of them, and using the same routine and repititive tactics everyone else is using to win.  Clearly, neither option is ideal or agreeable since better game design would've prevented this dilemma.  As a corollary to this, when you do happen to play rarely-chosen, lower tier character, there's a bit of unfamiliarity working its way into the match, and so you'll face the difficulty of a fairly novel match-up.  This is of course frustrating as well, albeit for different reasons.

Also, as mentioned earlier, the game has a peculiar lack of depth and variety.  Some may argue that each characters has several moves, some of which require real skill and practice and timing to pull off consistently, and in the right situations.  While this is true, it's also apparent that gameplay at the higher levels is virtually always compressed into the same kind of predictable struggles over and over again.  If you're a projectile player, the game bsaically dictates that you MUST hurl projectile after projectile to get the other player jumping and inching towards you, at which point you must strike them out of the air if possible.  For each character, there is of course a variation in strategy because of the differing move-sets, but essentially there's very little creativity or options in SF4 as the total number of possibilities is quickly condensed down to the very few strategies that actually work.  Again, this set of circumstances is the result of fairly linear thinking with respect to game design.

For all its faults though, SF4 does somehow manage to be quite addictive, even though, ironically, the gaming experience itself doesn't warrant the amount of time devoted.  I suppose this strange paradox, however, does earn its developer, Capcom, some credit.",Suffers from serious character imbalances,1263600000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Having beaten GTA IV I would say that San Andreas was the series' zenith.

GTAIV tries to head in a more cinematic direction (similar to The Getaway series, if you've ever played that).  During the first one-third of the game, it succeeds.  But the cohesion of the story gradually unwinds....the charecters and their struggles aren't really as developed or belivable after a certain point (though first third was brilliant, with Russian gangster Vlad, or the tension between Playboy X/Dwayne).

Example:  you spend the whole game looking for some guy you've never met.  While I won't spoil the conclusion, I thought it was hard to get attached to the story line, given that many of the final events seem to be random (in otherwords, the story is not well developed, especially during the final 25% of the game...new charecters appear out of no where, and some of the missions began to feel meaningless)

GOOD:
- Unique ""Darkness"" powers and give you the abilities like sending out a tentacle creature that can stealth kill your enemies, Stab people/objects with another type of Shadow Tentacle, create black hole vortex that sucks up everything in its path and spits it back out, use demonic looking guns that shoot Lighting & Thunder (which are also fueled by the shadows around you) and even summon four different types Minions to do your bidding.
- Watch TV, the TVs in the game play real movies, cartoons, and music videos and you can even change the channel too.
- It's not all shooting, in this game you come to claim points where you can interact with non combat characters in a open ended (go almost to any part of the game at any time) version of New York City. In these parts of the game you can meet and talk (but mostly do favors) for the citizens of NYC or just be a jerk and kill them.
- Great voice acting.
- Graphics look good (for 2007) and animations are fairly smooth as well.

BAD:
- Shooting/knocking out lights while unique in the first hour of gameplay or becomes more of a choir and distraction as the game progress.
- Some people might find the story of the game disjointed and clich.
- Some times the Darkness powers don't seem to work the way you want or need in a situation, example The Darkling (your minions) have very simple A.I. and seem almost useless in some situations by not attacking enemies or running head long into bright areas (where they die instantly), and the Darkness Guns which act like traditional guns have no real value next your standard guns, outside of the fact that they have unlimited ammo and no reloading in the dark (also note they have no ammo in the light).
- The online gameplay feels tacked on and is glitchly, unless a patch comes out for it I would say stay away from the multiplayer option of this title.

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- A decent range and Varity of your standard issue First Person Shoot type of guns, with Shotgun, Duel pistols/SMG's and M16 types.
- The aiming sight in the game is just a simple red dot, which while it frees up space on your screen a few people might find it difficult to aim with.
- The lack of a true or traditional HUD (Heads up Display for health/power meter and such) can make the game confusing and difficult to some.
- Being in the light makes your Darkness powers very weak or even not available (in bright light), so you're going to spend lots of time seeking out shadows in order to use your powers and get the most out of this game.
- It's not all in the streets of NYC; some parts of the game take place in a dream world that looks like a hell version of World War 1.
- This game is for adults or mature gamers as most of the dialog is full of foul words and the content of this game can be pretty gory, for example your dark tentacles eat human hearts (they show them ripping the hearts out of your slain enemies chests and chewing them up, not joking) to gain new power, and also getting close to any enemy with your guns drawn and shooting them up close will make the game go into an animation where you (pretty violently) execute the your enemy (examples are shots fired into an enemies leg followed by a shots to the head).

Guns all have their own feel, but control of character is a tad chunky, as well controller sensitivity levels are lacking.  Matchmaking works well and a whole lot of different customizations all around.

If the game was $40 I would be happy, but it is a generation behind the BF3 and Black Ops standard and I don't see a $60 value here.  Also, as noted, the graphics you may have seen in trailers are not even close to what is actually rendered in multiplayer.

While I usually find Eidios games to fall short of quality games due to the UI, this game was different.  It is solid.  The game engine runs better than most 3d shooter games.  The best way to describe this game is a James Bond version of Thief or Thief II.  You sneak around performing tasks such as stealing a truck etc.  The weapons are very realistic, the graphics are great and the game is fun.
I would highly recommend giving the demo a try.  My only gripe would be the lack of multiplayer.

Not as much as the first, but then again that game just surprised me with how unexpectedly awesome it was. As I said, not bad. Playing as the full on Dracula is great. Of course you gain abilities as you progress and it's always exciting when you get the next one. A decent challenge difficulty-wise. It has New Game Plus if you wanna jump back in.

Once more Kite adventures into the many fields and dungeons of 'The World' seeking loot, experience, and trying to safe the world (the real world) from a virus gone out of control.  This time, though,  all the loose threads are drawn together, answers are provided, and the glow of a new day restores the shine to the gaming world.
If you are new to the game, you are likely to find Quarantine a bit difficult to play and confusing to understand.  While it can be done, I think a very large part of the series' charm is the slow, game-by-game, building of character and story.  With the earlier games now available at discounted prices the best strategy is to start at the beginning and work forward.  Do not, however, try to play the games one right after another.  Spread out, their similarity doesn't interfere with enjoyment.  Taken all at once, it is quite possible to overdose on grunties.
If you have been following the series than expect no great surprises.  Well, there are one or two, but for the most part everything is a natural progression from the previous games.  While the plot undertakes some interesting twists, gameplay is pretty much a matter of bigger and badder.  If you have been religiously leveling up in prior episodes then Quarantine will feel a bit too easy.  If you have been getting through by the skin of your teeth then there will be some tough fights ahead.
I felt that Quarantine was a little too short, and not as spectacular as I expected.  There is provision for playing after the game is complete, including an item challenge, and some familiar characters will suddenly become available.  Unfortunately quarantine features a smaller set of monsters.  Most often data bug variations of ones you have already seen.  There is a little voice in my head that keeps telling me that Bandai would have been better off packaging this game in three episodes rather than four.
Of course, that means they would have had to find another way to deliver the Liminality OVAs.  This last episode is excellent, providing a lot of information on the nature of the.hack world as well as an exciting conclusion.  We see both the outside and the inside of The World in one tidy package.  In retrospect, the game is the weakest link in the entire marketing package (I'm not completely sure about the manga either), simply because Bandai chose to leave it unchanged for four episodes.  However, many of the concepts behind the .hack package are quite novel, even if a bit overplayed.

(For those of you that don't know, it's pretty easy to fake the amount of storage a device has by using certain software. It'll make the device look like it has the proper amount of storage, however when you get past a certain amount of data, it'll overwrite existing data or not write at all.) Turns out, it's pretty hard to properly test when the save files are 1.5 mb in the most extreme cases. Anyway, I don't think that this memory card is faking the amount of storage it has, because 128mb isn't that much space to begin with. If I encounter any issues with this, I will most certainly update this review.

Anyway, I would not recommend this device to be used as your PRIMARY memory card. Saving and loading times on this memory card are much slower compared to a stock 8mb Sony memory card.

4.0,False,"10 8, 2010",A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000FRU0NU,tvtv3,"I didn't get introduced to the Halo franchise until much later than most people. HALO had been out for several years and HALO 2 had been released for over a year by the time I purchased an Xbox and sat down to play the campaign of HALO.  After beating that, it was about six months later before I had an opportunity to sit down and play through the campaign of HALO 2.  I understand that for most Xbox games nowadays, the big thing that many gamers look for is the multiplayer game play.  I'm not like that.  For me, first and foremost in a game is the campaign mode.  I love stories and in writing and filmmaking, story really does triumph over everything else and my experiences with gaming is no different.  If the story captures me, then I'm probably going to really enjoy the game even if the graphics aren't superior and the sound is low key and there aren't a lot of multiplayer options.

I was really looking forward to playing HALO 3.  HALO 2 was an amazing second act to the franchise and it raised all sorts of interesting questions. The game play is also unique because for over half the game you play as the Arbiter, an individual who until then had been seen as an enemy to humanity.  However, the campaign of that game ended on a cliffhanger with the Covenant invasion of Earth.

The campaign begins immediately where HALO 2 ended.  Master Chief crashes to Earth and joins the forces there to end the Covenant invasion.  They succeed, but by the end of the battle join forces with the Covenant to quarantine and eradicate Flood-infected areas of Earth.  Later a small group of humans and Covenant, including Master Chief and the Arbiter, proceed through a slipstream portal in pursuit of the Prophet Truth who intends to activate all the remaining Halo rings.  Along the way, Master Chief and the Arbiter join forces with the Flood Gravemind to prevent Truth's plan, but after stopping him Gravemind breaks his alliance and attempts to incorporate Master Chief and the Arbiter into itself.  Then there's Cortana, the AI with a personality.  She's captured by Gravemind and Master Chief has to rescue her. It all builds to a satisfying conclusion.

As for as actual game play is concerned, I was disappointed with HALO 3.  The campaign provides a satisfying conclusion, but it's much too short.  So much of the build-up to HALO 3 was around the Covenant invasion of Earth, but there's really only about 1/4th of the entire campaign that is actually spent there.  Not only that, but the entire storyline really doesn't take very long to get through.  In fact, the most difficult part of the game, in my opinion, was the last part of the game and Master Chief has to drive over and around parts of the new Halo as it collapses around itself while he makes his way back to the getaway ship.  That part was like a giant puzzle and quite frankly I didn't like it very much.  In shooters, people like to shoot and fight and there wasn't very much of that going on.

I was also disappointed that you are limited to playing with Master Chief. One of the most interesting parts of playing HALO 2 is that you got to also play as the Arbiter. That doesn't happen in HALO 3. In fact, other than his brief appearances at the beginning of some scenes, and a few cut scenes, the Arbiter appears nonexistent.  Master Chief is humanity's hero, but every hero has some side kicks crucial to his success.  You get to see a little of that in HALO 3, but you don't get to play it.

There are several new weapon upgrades in HALO 3 as well as a few new vehicles.  There's also another group of objects known as Equipment that the player can use.  The graphics are great and sound quality is exceptional.

I haven't played the multiplayer settings very often, but HALO 3 has some great ones. In fact, HALO 3 was probably the best multiplayer experience until MODERN WARFARE 2 came out. Personally, I just can't get very involved in multiplayer. I play a few times and it's exciting, but then the experience looses its luster for me.

In short, though there are some good improvements in the campaign mode from HALO 2, the game is too short and lacks some of the improvements from HALO 2, such as the time spent playing as the Arbiter.  However, in terms of multiplayer experiences, HALO 3 is exceptional.",The Original Halo Trilogy Concludes,1286496000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The bad news is that this game has exactly the same flaw as Guitar Hero 2: When you get stuck on a song, there isn't a good way to move on. I just blasted through the first 20 (or so) songs on expert mode and only had to repeat 3 or 4 of them. No problem there at all. And then, all of a sudden, one of the songs I just could not get through. Not sure whether it is a balancing issue, actually. It might just be that it is a song that for some reason is hard for me (and might be easy for others). But in any event: I now probably spend 3/4 of my time with this game on this one song that I do not like and cannot do. And I have no way to get passed it, since I have to complete it to unlock more songs.

Lane,"Having only played a demo back in 2005 of the Room, I wasn't too sure of what to expect when I spontaniously bought the game just for the sake of leaving the store with something in hand. I brought it home with fingers crossed, and played a couple hours and found myself immediately delighted with what I was seeing.

On a technical level it wouldn't impress even the most leneint critic (for being on the 360/PS3 it should've done more), although I read somewhere it was a significant leap over the original... but the value came in the form of connecting me with a (familiar) raw and visceral gaming experience that demands your entire attention in progressing through the game. It was also mentioned somewhere that it is best played with classical controls, as the sense of horror is made more prominent with the lack of finesse in manuevering the character around those things that also walk around.

The bad guys are kind of pathetic at first... a dude with their arms infused with their torso that throws up on you; like a bunch of amputees roaming a town after a frat party or something. Then the game just gives you stick... and with the limited controls, your standing there swinging and swinging while the paralegic is spewing an endless supply of 'vomit mist' which has minimal effect on you (on a normal setting).

The camera can be frustrating at times... but like most nostalgic adults these days, this lack of attention to detail can be summerized as 'enhancing the horror effect' by limiting what you can see on the screen. But you and I know it's lazy programming, which inadvertantly has the said consequence. The SOUND could be better, some of the sounds in the environment are 'contained' (not dynamic), as a gamer I would like to know where a sound is coming from (and how far away it is)... but just like the camera it could just all be deliberate and is held as a part of the whole 'experience'.

The one thing I like about the game is that it doesn't hold your hand like most games these days, infact when I encountered an enemy for the first time... it was awkward. As I was standing there in a small confined space with a wooden plank in hand being spewed on for a couple of minutes before I figured out the unintuitive controls *(which again aids in the whole experience). Soon as I figured out the controls, the combat felt campy... and it reminded me a lot of my time with WoW. Your character and the enemy stands in one place (with a melee weapon) exchanging blows until one invariably dies of a depleted health bar. Actually some enemies don't even die, they lie down and start squirming around on the ground in a creepy fashion.

The story is pretty good so far... speaking solely from having only played through the title sequence and a brief cutscene with some random woman in a graveyard. It's worth the money if you're willing to spend it on this... and it's a steal of you really really like it, if this type of game is not your cup of tea; then you will be shafted.

4.0,False,"02 18, 2014",A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B00C7103DO,D.G.M.,"This is the first Batman game in the Arkham series not developed by Rocksteady, instead it was done in-house with series publisher WB Games. Once this information was revealed, it was an immediate concern for fans of the series who feared that Arkham Origins would not live up to its predecessors Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Fortunately, WB Games did a better job than I and many others expected. While Arkham Origins does possess some noticeable flaws that were much less apparent in the two previous games, WB Games has proven that they have what it takes to develop an overall great game all on their own without having Rocksteady do most of the heavy lifting. Overall, they get a solid B+ in Rocksteady's School of Gaming. Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel in the series showing a younger, less experienced Batman just two years into his crimefighting career. Most criminals still believe him to be a myth or urban legend, while others (namely the ones Batman has already beaten up) know better. The Gotham City Police Department is also on the hunt for the mysterious vigilante who constantly shows them up and makes life miserable for the largely corrupt officers who make up the department. The game opens on Christmas Eve with a breakout at Blackgate Prison started by Black Mask, who ends up killing the corrupt commissioner of the GCPD and causing general havoc in the prison. Batman attempts to interfere with Black Mask's plans, so the mob boss retaliates by placing a 50 million dollar bounty on Batman's head, which a number of assassins like Killer Croc, Deathstroke, Bane, Deadshot, and others are all too happy to collect. Batman is then given free reign to explore all of Gotham City as he hunts down Black Mask, the assassins, and other baddies who apparently have nothing better to do than cause trouble in the streets on Christmas Eve.

Given that Batman is able to explore Gotham for the first time before part of it was walled off to form a prison, I was hoping to be able to experience saving civilians from thugs and villains like in so many of those Spider-Man games I have, but absolutely no civilians have been included in this game, likely because the developers were either not up to the task or were simply too lazy, and they use a nasty blizzard as a very convenient plot-device to explain why there are no civilians on the streets. Despite that somewhat flimsy excuse for the absence of civilians, the story for Arkham Origins is actually quite strong and compelling, comparable to the stories of its predecessors. The earlier parts are kind of slow, but a plot twist a little later on introducing the Joker as the true mastermind behind the night's events makes things a lot more interesting (that last sentence was not a spoiler, the Joker's presence in this game was known well before its release). Also, seeing Bruce Wayne's earlier relationships with Alfred and future allies Jim and Barbara Gordon really add just the right amount of drama and fitting foreshadowing. As an added note, the new voice actors they got for Batman and Joker are very decent replacements for Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, especially Joker's voice actor.

Gameplay in Arkham Origins is largely the same as it was in the previous games, with a few tweaks here and there. First off, Batman can travel around the city just as well as he could before by gliding and using his grapnel gun to zip himself to ledges and rooftops. The area of Old Gotham that made up Arkham City in the titular game (before it fell into disrepair) makes up the northern portion of the map. A long bridge forms the middle portion, while the slightly smaller and flashier area of New Gotham makes up the southern portion of the city. Due to the larger explorable area, Batman can fast travel between different districts with the Batplane, but only after unlocking the jammed radio towers located in each district. In the spirit of the previous games, there are hundreds of collectibles to find left by Enigma, the original alias of the Riddler, in all the nooks and crannies of Gotham City. He left behind many datapackets (the precursors to the Riddler trophies) that have to be collected and relays that have to be destroyed (but thankfully no riddles that have to be scanned). However, there are a number of hidden messages left by other characters that have to be scanned with Batman's handy Detective Mode, which can be a challenge to find. A lot of the gadgets like batarangs, batclaw, explosive gel, smoke pellets, and cryptographic sequencer return, as well as a lower tech version of the disruptor that is aimed and fired like the remote electrical charge from Arkham City, and therefore requires better aim. There's also the glue grenade, which works exactly like the freeze blast from Arkham City, only it holds enemies in place with glue instead of ice.

There are a couple of new gadgets as well. The remote claw lets Batman fire a retracting cable at enemies that can attach them to environmental objects, other enemies, or vantage points to damage or knock them out, but it's chiefly used to create a wire that lets Batman reach normally inaccessible areas or zipline through high breakable walls. The concussion detonator temporarily disorients and blinds nearby enemies to give Batman the edge during combat. The most notable gadget/weapon the Dark Knight acquires are the Shock Gloves: after beating on enough enemies, these gloves gain an electric charge that doubles the damage of Batman's punches and even lets him directly damage armored enemies, shielded enemies, and enemies with shock batons. Speaking of enemies, they're largely unchanged from the previous games, though there are a couple of new additions, mainly extra big thugs and martial artists who require a bit of strategy to defeat. The boss battles and other encounters with classic Batman villains are also quite fun, and a couple are rather challenging, although some are reminiscent of certain battles and encounters from previous games. The boss battle against Copperhead for example plays out very similarly to Batman's battle with Ra's Al Ghul from Arkham City, only with a darker hallucinogenic vibe to it. The encounter with the Mad Hatter plays out in a similar 2D sidescrolling fashion as the nightmarish encounters with Scarecrow in Arkham Asylum, although the Mad Hatter encounter is largely inferior. These similarities aren't necessarily bad, just a little too familiar, nevertheless I still had plenty of fun with the boss encounters.

There are also plenty of side missions, with the majority of them having Batman going around Gotham and putting a stop to other villains' plans by destroying targets of interest, disarming bombs, or tracking down and rescuing hostages. For the first time ever in the Arkham series, there are also random crimes that pop up throughout the city that must be stopped. They include stopping gang fights, defending lowly criminals from police brutality, stopping ATM robberies, and defending yourself from ambushes. One other addition to the game revolves around crime scene investigations. They basically used the same crime solving techniques from Arkham City and expanded on them a bit. Like before, Batman can use his Detective Mode to scan for evidence like blood samples and bullet trajectories, only now he can virtually recreate the crime with his Detective Mode, rewinding and fast forwarding the footage to find even more previously unseen clues. An interesting gameplay mechanic, but not altogether game changing either. The only other change in this game revolves around Batman's acquisition of new gadgets and abilities. While most of them are gained automatically at certain points in the main story, certain gadgets and skills like the sonic batarangs and special takedown moves, as well as certain gadget upgrades, can only be acquired by fulfilling challenges in the game's Dark Knight System. These challenges are very much like the Riddler challenges in Arkham City, like gliding for long distances without touching the ground, taking out all enemies in a predator encounter unseen, or reaching a high multiplier count while fighting a large group of enemies. A lot of these challenges can be pulled off without even trying, but there are a few of them that can prove to be rather daunting or time consuming; fortunately, they're not necessary in order to get a 100% game completion. You can even have Batman fast travel to the Batcave at almost any time to get some practice in the challenge rooms, change his costume, or even chat with Alfred.

A lot of this may sound like a lot of the same stuff from the previous games, and it largely is, but I personally find no fault in that. What I do find fault in are this game's technical issues. The game can suffer from noticeable framerate slowdown at times, normally when lots of enemies are onscreen or when Batman fast travels with the Batplane, and the game froze on me a few times as well. The slowdown happens enough that it can get annoying, especially when it interferes with combat or while gliding around. Also, the in-game menu is a bit cluttered and certain things like finding quickfire gadget instructions or bringing up the correct menu to show collectibles on the map can be frustrating. Finally, there's the Initiation DLC which includes 5 challenge maps. What makes this DLC different from all the other ones this game has is that it's a story-based set of challenge maps letting the player experience Bruce Wayne's intense martial arts training under Master Kirigi before he became Batman. You play as Bruce Wayne decked out in ninja garb and armed with new weapons like shurikens, a grapple hook, and caltrops, as well as a sixth-sense like ability called Concentration, which basically works like a ""natural"" and slightly limited version of Detective Mode. Aside from dealing with ninja-type enemies in both combat and predator encounters, certain irremovable modifiers that add time limits or make enemies stronger and tougher add to the challenge, not to mention a limited number of retries (running out of retries leads to a game over and you have to start again from the first map). Initiation was a fun DLC, although the price was a bit high for such limited content. In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Origins is not a bad game by any means, in fact it fits in well with the other two games in the series and possesses a lot of the same addictive qualities that will keep gamers coming back to finish just one more mission. However, the cluttered menu and larger number of technical issues keep this from being a leap forward from Arkham City, instead it's more of a cautious step sideways and a half step backwards (the graphics also lack the gritty detail of the previous games, but that's not a huge issue to me). Still, at its current price, this game is worth a playthrough for any fans of Batman or the Arkham series in general.

**UPDATE**
This part of the review will focus on Arkham Origins' second story-based DLC Cold, Cold Heart, which showcases Batman's first encounter with Mr. Freeze. Taking place several days after the events of the main game, we find ourselves at Wayne Manor with Bruce Wayne hosting a charity event for Gotham's high society citizens and presenting a humanitarian award to Ferris Boyle, CEO of Gothcorp. It's not long before Mr. Freeze, accompanied by Penguin's henchmen, crashes the party and starts freeze blasting everything around him, then he goes after Ferris Boyle. Bruce suits up and takes action against Mr. Freeze and his thugs until Freeze escapes with Boyle, with Batman in hot pursuit. The rest of the game takes place in the southern portion of Gotham City from the main game (New Gotham), with the southernmost district (Burnley) blocked off by ice; the northern portions of the city, namely the bridge and Old Gotham, are also blocked off. One new location within New Gotham that Batman will explore as he hunts Mr. Freeze is the Gothcorp building, where the frozen villain himself first came to be. Batman starts out with the same gadgets as in the main game: batarangs, batclaw, cryptographic sequencer, remote claw, Shock Gloves, and so on, although the glue grenade is no longer available since it has proven to be unstable. About halfway through the campaign, Batman will don the bulky and totally awesome looking XE (Extreme Environment) Suit to help protect him from the extreme cold conditions normally associated with Mr. Freeze. The suit comes with Thermal Gloves, replacing the Shock Gloves, which actually serve the same function in combat, although they are also used to break through certain ice barriers and to thaw out a number of victims scattered about the city who have been frozen by Mr. Freeze's henchmen. The new suit also comes with thermal batarangs, which can be used to break through ice covering certain switches and vantage points, as well as detach large icicles from ceilings to have them fall on patrolling enemies.

The enemies Batman faces are the same as in the main game, mostly thugs with knives, body armor, and shields, though there are the occasional brutes and martial artists. One new enemy type are the thugs armed with their own cryogenic guns similar to Mr. Freeze's. Fighting these guys amidst a large group of regular thugs can make things challenging in a fun way, especially since it's possible to dodge these enemies' ice blasts and have them freeze other surrounding enemies instead. The usual predator sessions are peppered throughout the game, with a couple of them proving to be rather challenging, as well as a couple of crime scene sections to help round things out. Aside from the frozen victims that must be rescued, there are also some riots started by Anarchy's henchmen that must be quelled, as well as more hidden Anarchy tags to find with Detective Mode (and they're as challenging to find as before). Completing these side missions provides a few upgrades to Batman's gadgets, though they're not actually necessary to complete the game. It should be obvious who the final boss battle is against and it's a satisfying, if familiar, encounter. It's a two part fight that borrows elements from the boss battle against Mr. Freeze in Arkham City combined with the predator encounters against Deadshot and Black Mask in the main game of Arkham Origins. While not wholly original, the final boss battle was still fun. The story, while nothing new to those who have watched any episodes of Batman: The Animated Series featuring Mr. Freeze, was still well done and had my attention from beginning to end, largely since I've always found Mr. Freeze to be one of the more interesting and sympathetic of Batman's rogues gallery. Personally, I find Cold, Cold Heart to be the best DLC of all the Batman games. Compared to Arkham City's DLC (Harley Quinn's Revenge) and the other story-based DLC for Arkham Origins (Initiation), Cold, Cold Heart was the most complete and worthwhile DLC of them all.

On the downside, I found this game rather easy.

Ironically, I remember complaining about the Playstation 3's menu for inserting three redundant icons for the Playstation Store several years ago, even while admitting how elegant it looked. The Playstation 4 menu system doesn't look elegant. It looks atrocious. It's a slap in the face. It's so bizarre. Granted, the PS4 has different needs than the PS3, admittedly. But, the PS4 menu is a confusing mess. I can't find anything. It requires a Ph. D. to operate, or a year of practice. I'm going with the latter myself. And, since one recent update, the TV & Video section turned into a bunch of advertisements to things most people don't have. Netflix, maybe. Amazon Prime, maybe. Hulu, Crackle, CBS All-Access or HBO Now, unlikely. And, these are stuck in with You Tube. We got banner ads all over the screen! It's just a way to sell things. And, these aren't Sony products. I'm wondering if the reason they're all over the screen is because Sony gets kickbacks. Playstation Vue, I'm unlikely to use, unless I'm a wealthy aristocratic pig. The Quick Menu (available if holding down the PS button) is a good idea, mainly because everything elsewhere is such a mess. This is the final word on that.

I was hoping PS4 would have more 3D games. As of now, I only have two, and these are cheap ones: three Star Wars-themed pinball tables in Zen Pinball 2 and Super Stardust Ultra. Don't get me wrong. They're both good ones, and Super Stardust Ultra looks fantastic in 3D. It's just that there aren't any big titles in 3D. Gran Turismo 6 was in 3D, but Gran Turismo 7 (GT Sport) is not. Ironically, Sony is pushing its system of V.R. (virtual reality) glasses, which are in 3D. But, I can't play those games on my 3D television. I understand that people don't like passive or active 3D televisions, and that V.R. is a great 3D system, but I would think that doing one allowed me to do the other. That assumption would be incorrect. I don't know why games with V.R. compatibility aren't also 3D television compatible. I like 3D. I like movies in 3D. Luckily, the PS4 and PS3 both play 3D Bluray movies since a 2014 update. I understand that people get headaches watching 3D movies the way I got 3D headaches when I first bought prescription glasses, but the doctor prescribed them for me so that I could see well. I can't help nature. Life just works out that way for some people. The headache of getting used to glasses are part of enjoying life. Again, I like 3D. It's too bad Sony can't offer more for its newer console. In 2017, manufacturers stopped producing 3D televisions. Well, that's a shame. I know it was expensive, but I'm supposing the fad of V.R. glasses will go out of style in a few years. At least stereoscopic cinematic images go back to the beginning of cinema. People think of 3D movies as a fad. But, 3D movies return every few years, and they are part of cinema history, whether we get headaches or not. Because I've been willing to put up with the initial headache means I don't get headaches anymore. I've gotten used to 3D the way I've gotten used to wearing prescription glasses--and the doctor gave me those. The fact that a few people complain about a minor headache is simply not a valid reason to disenfranchise 3D. Maybe 3D is going out of style, but it'll return.

I read some reviews stating the graphics were bad. Perhaps the PC version has far superior graphics? All I know is I spent a lot of time in between the fighting just looking around at the fantastic blend of realism and fantasy environments. Trudging along snow-covered mountain passes, looking down to see thousands of Orcs miles below all carrying torches...beautiful! Cautiously, quietly moving through a dark, creepy wood with spider webs all about. These and many other beautifully rendered environments were a joy to behold.

Character models are also done very well. It is nice to play a game where not every dwarf looks exactly the same as every other dwarf (and the same goes for all the ""races""). Those characters included here which we met in the films are also rendered quite well.

Mechanics/Inferface - 6/10

I have played many CRPGs over the years...Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout, Elder Scrolls series, etc.. This game fits snugly into the Action RPG category. It does not have extraordinary depth in character customization, but what it has is adequate. Upon leveling you add to attributes and select skills from three skill trees for each character. This brings up a negative that I have learned to live with but wish it had been handled differently. You start the game as either a human male Ranger, an elven female mage, or a dwarven male fighter. At waypoints throughout the game you have the opportunity to switch to one of the other two or remain with the same character. Inhabiting one of the characters is the only time you can change their weapons, armor, or other gear, and add to their stats/skills. I would have liked a bar on the screen letting me know how close to one of these waypoints I was. The positive side of this gameplay is that those of us who tend to stick to one character type (mage, thief, or fighter) in most RPGs are encouraged to try out other styles of play. The interface is somewhat simple as this game is a console port, but everything works fine. Just don't expect a dozen spells and other things mapped to numerous keys.

Story - 9/10

I really enjoyed being part of the conflict depicted in the LotR yet not playing a rehash of the characters/plot of the books and movies. In WitN, you are a significant factor in helping the characters from the books/movies succeed, but you have your own adventures separate from those of Frodo. I felt the way the stories intertwined, and the way the characters interacted, was done very intelligently.

Gameplay - 7/10

My favorite type of game is the deep, open world, story driven RPG with lots of dialog (Baldur's Gate, Morrowind, and more recently Dragon Age and Mass Effect). Fighting is fun but can get repetitious in some games...as it does here. I played this game on Normal difficulty, and since I am not the greatest with real time button mashing, it is quite challenging. Fortunately, you have two computer controlled helpers (or co-op friends) which take some of the pressure off you in fights.

General Comments

I enjoyed this game far more than I expected to. The art style of the environments and the intertwining of the actual events and characters from LotR with your own unique adventure were big positives, overcoming the somewhat repetitious fighting and minimal character customization typical of the Action RPG genre.

4.0,False,"02 5, 2007",A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000LLUXDW,Michael Kerner,"Back when the Nintendo DS was launched in 2004, the first game that was released was a revised edition of Super Mario 64. the game really showed how dynamic and far the system would. It definitely was one of the most brilliant games I've ever played on the N64, and it was again on the Nintendo DS. Another classic is returning from the Nintendo 64 era just now. Back in 1997, Diddy Kong Racing was one of the most thrilling race games ever made. The gameplay was absolutely amazing, and it showed a new element in kart racing that hadn't been seen. Now it is returning to the Nintendo DS, but can it speed for gamers the way it did nearly 10 years ago?

Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo DS brings the element of Diddy Kong and friends as they try to secure, and revise Timber Island from the cluches of the vulgar Wizpig and his crew by racing through over 20 tracks ranging that tests your ability to feel speed. In this game, you'll race from the traditional karts, as well as hovercrafts and small planes too. The graphics are definitely in tune and have been remastered beautifully from its N64 original, but there are a lot of changes in this edition. One of the changes is the character lineup. In this version, Conker the Squirel and Banjo Bear, yes Banjo from Banjo-Kazooie are not in this edition, as they were with the original version. Another change is the challenges. When the N64 version came out, you had to battle through a silver coin challenge, inorder to battle against the bosses for the second match of the challenge. In this version, you'll have to endure a balloon popping challenge, which endures a bit more to handle with the stylus in play. The game also brings out a bit more in play, by adding a couple of new additions, like placing the wi-fi connection in by having you race and challenge up to 8 racers, and a new wish mode, where you can actually create and race against others on tracks which you can customize, and make for your own.

All in all, if you haven't yet played Diddy Kong Racing from its N64 era, it is definitely worth trying. But for veteran racers who've mastered the original version, they'll probably be in for a few treats here as well. While this racer was always a step behind what made Mario Kart so well in the gameplay, it still pleases die hard racing fans. I definitely recommend this as a must buy for the Nintendo DS.

The game favors a top-view perspective over the classic 2D gameplay we'd come to expect from Contra. The controls only provide a few presets in the options menu, which is a big let down. I'd prefer the square button to be for firing, but no such option is available. You do get four playable characters in the game like in Contra: Hard Corps, each with their own set of weapons. Really, everyone has the machine gun and flamethrower, but it's the other two weapons that are unique. The lock-aim could have been more smooth, as it's turned on with one of the L-buttons like a trigger instead of holding it down like in Contra III. It only really locks your player's weapon direction though rather than actually locking onto individual enemies, which could have helped tremendously on bosses that seem to require homing weapons (or at least they're really difficult to face without them). The game has some awkward platforming at times - being an overhead game, it really doesn't work as well as you'd hope it would. It also uses sprites for the player character and foot-soldiers which look kinda funny in a 3D environment, but I suppose it's passable. The best quality of the game though is easily the soundtrack; most every song is actually really well done - I especially like the second song that plays on stage 3 (River of Destruction) as it has an awesome guitar solo that fits so nicely in a Contra-type setting. Although I never really cared much for the Jungle tunes.

The game to me has become a guilty pleasure, as I've adjusted to the controls as best as I could, and even found myself having a little fun with it when I feel I'm able to. Something to keep note of though - never make the mistake of playing this on hard mode; as a veteran to the Contra franchise, I can even say the difficulty on hard gets way too frustrating, even after adjusting to the awkward controls. There's some other odd problems with the game; when continuing the game after getting a game over, for some reason you start off with either one or two less lives than the first time you start up the game (so playing with five lives starting the game means all other continues will be with three lives). For some screwy reason, you can't save after beating stage 5, so you have to beat stages 5 and 6 in a row if you hope to reach another save point. Also, you can't use the lock-aim on the last level at all, which is especially annoying. There's lots of other little oddities throughout the game that just seem to support the idea that this was likely a rushed title, which only adds to the overall lesser-experience most people would believe it to be.

Honestly, even though there are many problems this game has as a Contra title, I still find myself returning once in a while. It's ironic that even though I consider Legacy of War the weakest in the franchise, it does have one incredibly well done soundtrack that is worthy of the Contra title. It's just sad the game itself couldn't live up to that expectation. All the same, if you're especially a fan of the Contra games, it might be worth investigating this little title for your own collection.

The idea is deceptivley simple- throw a variety of objects at towers/buildings/constructs of blocks...knock them down, pull pieces away, create domino effects and all that jazz to score points.  By and far the most fun are the levels where you can destroy everything.  Other levels let you pull pieces away from the larger structure a la Jenga or similar games.
The best part of this game is figuring out the least amount of ""moves"" needed to complete each goal.  The physics engine is quite good and things react, for the most part, as you would expect them to.  The ability to move the field around and change some perspective is helpful and actually necessary to complete levels and goals as you progress through the game.

They don't get all the finer points, but they have fun knocking things down and doing some of the simpler levels. I myself, like the challenge that the ""story"" (explore) mode offers.  So the game is great for kids and adults alike.  Totally gets my vote for that one!
The editing features are nice, but somewhat limited in my opinion.  You start with a blank field in which to build with a whole plethora of choices for blocks, doors, walls, buildings...but the game has a limit on what can be placed on the field before it gets ""full.""  And it fills up fast.  I barely had enough memory space to plunk down two guard towers, some bomb blocks, a mini wall and some gem blocks before I was not allowed to place anything else- but the worst part was all that unused space on the editing field.  It felt a little dissapointing to me.  With the next generation hardware and memory, one would think they would be able to create bigger and better levels.  Minor annoyance, but still one that irks me at times.
The multiplayer mode is good, and while I haven't used it extensivley- it works well for two players and the split screen is handled nicely.  I haven't gone online or anything like that as of yet- and don't plan to, so I cannot review or rate those features of the game.
The storyline is loose and simplistic, just what one would expect from a game of this presentation- and that isn't a bad thing at all.  Having a story kind of ties a few things together and makes the goals make a bit more sense, but doesnt take any attention away from the wonderful gameplay.  One thing to watch out after you are done playing this game...""Wii elbow""- boy did the soreness strike with a vengance the next day!  That being said, I love this game and am glad that we purchased it.

4.0,False,"08 21, 2012",A232GGIYDFGVE1,B003VUO6H4,Andy,"For the longest time, I had been debating as to whether or not to sell my beloved Xbox 360 and purchase a Playstation 3. Let me begin by first stating that both consoles are great, and choosing either one depends upon your own personal preference. I know this is a review about the PS3, but let me clarify as to why I had been contemplating on selling the Xbox to purchase this fine piece of technology.

I'd been an owner of the Xbox 360 for quite a while; since November of 2006 to be precise. Over the course of the years that followed, I'd gotten the red rings (which I know we're all familiar with) three times. It was at that third time when I'd begun thinking of porting over to a PS3, but I simply loved my Xbox too much. In later events, I purchased the Elite model running with the Jasper chip which I had absolutely no problems with. I know that with the late Elite models as well as the new Slim models, the red rings are virtually gone, but still, I felt as though something else wasn't working for me. The more I started to compare the two consoles, the more I had wanted to switch to Playstaiton.

Graphically, both consoles are almost in sync. The Xbox uses an AMD based graphics component while the PS3 is dedicated to Nvidia. Now, both look very well, except that the AMD GPU in which the Xbox uses has a wider range of shader cores and pipelines. This means that 360 games can operate at a higher framerate than that of the PS3 multi-platform counterparts, and also provides more definition to the overall appearance of the graphics in terms of contrast and black levels. Though, I will discuss right now where this comparison gets a bit tricky.

The processors in both machines are very good. The Xbox runs on a triple core processor clocked at some 3.xGhz as is the Playstation's. However, the PS3 only has a single-core processor that utilizes 7 SPE's, or synergistic processing elements. Each SPE has a task to carry unlike conventional processors. For example, one SPE will handle the physics of the game, while another controls the artificial intelligence, and so on and so forth. Now, the part that gets tricky is comparing the GPU and CPU altogether. While Xbox has showed that a majority of the multi-platform games look better on its console than that of the PS3, this is only partly true because developers haven't taken the time to fully utilize all seven SPE's within the Playstation. They claim the Playstation's processor to be too confusing and because of this they do a mediocre job of porting games over to the console. However, when you look at Sony exclusives, they undoubtedly look better than any other multi-plat games on either the Xbox or Playstation (in my opinion). The PS3 has great potential. Only thing is, no one takes the time to take advantage of it. Take Uncharted 2, for example. The game looks visually stunning, and Naughty Dog claims that it's taken almost 100 percent usage of the SPE's in the Playstation, and they've also managed to hand over calculations from the GPU over to the CPU, which is incredible. So, in my opinion, I believe that the PS3's GPU and CPU are superior, though developers just don't take the time to make it so, and Xbox typically ends up with the better looking and operating multi-platform games.

Ultimately, in 2009, I'd purchased a PS3 Slim, though not long after I'd sold it because of it's sluggish download and installation speeds. Regardless of those two setbacks, in all honesty and my own opinion, the online play (though it is free) runs no different than the same game would on Xbox Live. This is one of Sony's hugest selling points with the PS3--free online play, and for me, it worked remarkably well. On Xbox, fairly often a game would lag online or I'd get kicked due to server errors. On PS3.. I've only been kicked out of a game once, and it was because someone had a weak connection on Uncharted I'm certain. In all the months I've been using the console to play Uncharted 2 & 3, Killzone, Assassin's Creed Revelations online, GTA 4, etc., not once has it ever lagged after. It's sad. Sony has been kind of generous to us. They give us superior online play for free, while Xbox users are required to pay for a mediocre service. I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I've heard that the reason PS3's online play is better at times is because it uses dedicated servers, while Xbox does not. Xbox runs on host servers for most games, which would explain all the lag. What I've come to discover, however, is that the people who seem to complain of PS3's online play, run their connection over wifi. In my opinion, I believe that using a LAN connection will give you optimal speeds and a more stable connection as opposed to a wireless one. I don't believe that the Playstation's wifi is ideal (and this may be because it uses 802.11b/g, and not 802.11b/g/n which is prime for gaming). Regardless, if you have a wired connection to your router, or modem, you needn't worry about a thing.

After selling the Playstation 3, I continued on in using my Xbox for quite a while longer. I convinced myself to be happy with it, until I had to renew my Gold subscription once more. It was at that point that I'd realized in the course of 4 years, I'd spent over $200 in Xbox Live Gold subscription fees and more so on all of the accessories like the battery packs, camera, charging docks, cables, etc. Even more, it was also around that time that I'd begun to see more and more people begin hacking almost half of the games I'd played online. GTA 4, Call of Duty, and Halo: Reach to name a few were all being compromised by hackers. This is something that should be prevented if I'm expected to pay a fee to play online, so why wasn't it? What I guess you could say sent me over the edge, was the new Xbox Live update which occurred in late 2011. Though I wasn't too fond of the new dashboard update, I immediately discovered when getting into Netflix that the party system was completely removed and would later be added again (as an additional fee). When reading of this news, I simply rid myself of the console and purchased a PS3 once again.

I figured to use the machine as an all-in-one console; making use of it's built-in bluray player to eliminate my current one (which the Xbox 360 does not have), the free online play (which the Xbox 360 requires one to pay for), and the built-in battery within the controller (which the Xbox 360 requires you to pay for as well). Upon those features in which I've stated, the console also delivers probably THEE best audio quality sound in games because of its bluray format. It is pure uncompressed audio that rivals anything in the market today. So, basically, if you're a big home theater enthusiast, you might prefer purchasing a Playstation 3. It will go perfectly with your home theater system. And because you don't need to pay for an online subscription, you needn't worry about having to pay one to use Netflix on the console. If you're already an existing Netflix member, all you have to do is activate it directly through your Playstation 3 and you're good to go! With Xbox, you're required to have a Gold subscription before you're allowed to use your Netflix account on it.

Last, but not least--I was pleasantly surprised to find that once I'd repurchased the console, those two setbacks I'd mentioned previous have been completely resolved. I have no idea what Sony did in one of their recent upgrades to the firmware of the system, but installation and download speeds are remarkably better than they were just last year. Installing and downloading items are a breeze. I hope this helped in your decision. Thank you for reading. Sony had a slow start, but they're picking up again, and I believe with the PS4 which will hopefully be released within the next year that Sony will redeem themselves.",Nice Switch From The Xbox 360,1345507200,3,,

The familiar white hood returns again, this time during the American Revolutionary War. But is this year's entry in the series as memorable as previous ones?

AC 3 stars Connor, a Native American who seeks revenge on the people who have destroyed his home, while also starring Desmond Miles in the present/future. I never was a big fan of Desmond's story; I always felt it was there to ""pull you out"" of the meat of the game. It is better than previous games (more action based, less rambling) and has some decent twists and turns, but Connor's story is significantly less memorable than Ezio's and Altier's of the previous games. While Ezio was witty, clever, and charming, and Altier was serious but likable, Connor's dialogue is flat and boring. And with a few exceptions involving Connor's tribe being destroyed, he does little to pull the player into the game's large and incredibly detailed world (which is awesome to both play in and look at). That being said, I'm a huge fan of the game's time period, and it put a smile on my face seeing Connor interact with some of the war's significant leaders and soldiers alike.

The game's signature block-then-strike gameplay returns, and it flows better than previous games, allowing you to tackle multiple attacking foes at once. The incredibly gory takedowns also return, but are MUCH more varied, and are a treat to watch. This makes the repetitive gameplay seem less so, even if most of the weapons feel the same with different animations. The naval battles in this game are better than most FULL PIRATE games (to the point they made the fourth game into one). Anyone who buys this game and skips these are SERIOUSLY missing out, because they are probably my favorite part of the game. Other side quests involve finding random chests in the woods (boring), a deep hunting system (very fun!), and building up a small town to earn you more money later on (missed opportunity here, I felt it was shallow and a chore to do). There are a LOT of things to do in this game when the main story is done putting you to sleep. The multiplayer returns from previous games, with a few new game modes to change it up. Most of these work, and it is a fun distraction from the game's lengthy single player campaign.

4.0,True,"01 30, 2010",A1AYBKV6DO2389,B001NTFATI,Don&#039;t Panic,"I would say that I have a mouse fettiche.  My favorite mouse of all time was the Logitech Wingman PS-2 gaming mouse.  The ony drawback to that mouse was the lack of a thumb-buitton and scroll wheel, but for it's time it was awesome.  Logitech has not come close to that degree of mousing perfection since...that is until the G9x.  I did not have the G9 so I can not compare them.  The last mouse I had was the G5, and there is no comparison.  First let me start with what is good about the mouse, since there is so very little that is bad.

The Good:
Ergonomics - the ergonomics are about as close to perfect as you could imagine.  Just like the Wingman Gaming Mouse, it is more of a wedge shape which just seems to fit the hand perfectly.  Ergonomics are only enhanced by the multiple enclosures which have a very pleasing texture and non-slip grip.  This is a new feature not seen in any mouse before and I think it is now a must-have.

Weight - As with many prior mice, you can fine tune the weight and there is a good selection of weights.  With the heaviest load it has excellent heft.

Cord - Nice, long, thin, braided fabric-wrapped cord does not interefere with mouse tracking.

Buttons - The buttons have a perfect action and solid detents.  The thumb buttons are positioned just right for a standard (non-claw) grip.  The scroll wheel has a very solid feel and smooth action.

Ashetics - Very handsome, selectable light colors are a plus.

Features - Scroll wheel can be changed from click-type to smooth-scrolling.  Selectable tracking speed is very well implemented.  Saveable game profiles with onboard memory is a nice feature if you do LAN parties.  I wouldn't use this, but nice to have anyway.

Tracking - smooth and precise, as you would expect from any modern mouse.

So what is bad?  Well for one thing it broke in the first week I had it.  I know things break, and I would not dock a star for that alone but this is an auspicious start for an otherwise outstanding mouse.  More importantly is that I think they left some important features out.  With your hand resting on the mouse, your 4th and 5th fingers just hang off the side...doing nothing.  Why not have a third button toward the right side to increase functionality?  If I were designing my perfect mouse, that feature would be there.  The front thumb button is difficult to reach without a claw grip.  I like the design of the Microsoft thumb buttons on their gaming mice better - with a vertical rather than horizintal orientation.  When are input device makers going to realize that it is easier to rotate the thumb rather than bend it?  The feet are not very slippery.  I replaced them with Hyperglide feet (from FrozenCPU).  Other than that I have to say that this thing is pretty close to perfect.  Hard to not recommend it for any PC gamer.  Even my wife loves the way it feels and she doesn't game at all.

Having said that, it is my firm belief that the Call of Duty franchise peaked at Modern Warfare, and has since resorted to releasing tired rehashes of the same game, just with tweaked weapons or game modes, and each with more adrenaline-fueled moments to try and keep you interested. I felt it was time for me to find something new, something that could breathe some fresh air into my interest in the FPS genre. That is where Brink comes in. Let me start with a list or pros and cons.

Pros:

-Excellent customization
-Awesome team-oriented gameplay
-Unique gameplay elements
-Nice art style
-Just fun to play in general

Cons:

-Team A.I. is horrid
-Imbalanced A.I. difficulty (Team vs. Enemy)
-Some graphical issues
-Plot sin't well presented

Pros:
(Customization) The character and weapon customization in this game is tremendous. There are dozens of options for clothing and hair, and mods for almost all weapons as well. It would be very difficult to find someone dressed exactly the same as you.
(Team-oriented) The game emphasizes team play. You get more experience points when you revive someone, heal them, give them ammo or complete objectives than you do if you just kill people. This may be a con for you lone wolves, but I enjoy games where you have to be a part of a larger force to succeed.
(Gameplay Elements) Brink features several unique elements, such as the S.M.A.R.T. movement system, which allows you to vaults, slide and climb your way through the levels. Another feature is the RPG-esque skill sets, which better your character in a specific class. This allows for even more customization.
(Art Style) The art is different, featuring cel-shaded graphics and slightly cartoony models. Again, could be a turn-off for some.
(Fun to Play) Pretty self explanatory. The gameplay gets frantic at times, pushing you to complete the last objective before the clock runs out.

Cons:
(Team A.I.) The bots on your team are mentally incapable. They seem to refuse to complete the actual objectives until you only have a couple minutes left to complete them. At all other times, the bots only care about capturing command posts and hunting down the other team.
(Imbalanced A.I.) The A.I. is serviceable early on, but once you get close to maxing out your character, the differences are very noticeable. Your team appears to have just graduated from boot camp, while the enemy is comprised solely of SEAL Team 6 veterans.
(Graphical issues) The textures in-game seem to take a long time loading, so that when you start a match the objects are all muddy looking. This fixes soon after, but it is very noticeable, even in cut-scenes.
(Plot) The plot isn't very well presented. To be honest, I still don't know what the hell is going on, though I've made no attempt to learn it.

After looking at other popular websites that sell AC2 there was mass confusion to say the least. Hong Kong versions w/ a figurine and no bonus levels, Canadian sellers listing a ""bilingual version"" and so on. I even had one Gamestop employee tell me there was no ""master assassin edition"" only a limited version. Well, it says it right here on the side of the plastic case. So here are the true details. The true ""master assassins edition"" should measure 8x6x10 inches. It comes in a nice mostly clear plastic casing that slips around a metal tin that has pictures of enzio on the front and back of tin. Front pic is close up of Enzio's face and back is full body pic of Enzio.
Inside you get the game shrinkwrapped, dvd-rom of bonus stuff w/ soundtrack and more, hardcover art book w/ sketches and the like plus 2 pre order bonus things: Medici map (preorder bonus) & Santa maria map (limited exclusive). Both are in-game maps.
Also comes with 8.5"" ezio statue incased in plastic.
So many people are trying to pass fakes and knock-offs of this thing I just wanted to give true fans a verbal discription to go by for the offical USA NTSC release. will be back later to update the review as I play the game!
Now, on to the game: I've played it for hours and here are my feelings compared to the first game. So far I have mixed feelings. There are tons of side missions that you can accept or deny depending on how thorough you want to complete the game. Enzio just got his assassins robe at the point I'm at so kep things like that in mind. This is a slowly building story w/ tons of dialogue and as of right now you do more non-killing tasks than anything else. There are doctors, blacksmiths, and equipment salesmen that you need to visit throughout the game and buy stuff from. You rob people, find hidden treasures and earn money completing certain tasks. It gives the game a slight ""Oblivion"" nod in that respect. Your health doesn't bounce back after major hits - you gotta reapir yourself or die.
Tons of side missions to choose from and the upgrade to double hidden blade kills, and grabbing someone while hiding in a haystack is pretty damn cool.
The scenery is great, townfolk look accurate and you can bribe prostitutes to distract pesky guards. For some reason there seems to be too many distractions in the form of early timed races, massive dialogue w/ thick Italian accents (yes, I am Italian) and a lack of fluid movements when trying to climb and move on the bldg. Could be just me as i am not an avid or constant gamer. I'm a big fan of Uncharted 2 if that helps.
There is no more in and out of Animus but both Desmond and Lucy look radically different this time around. It also gives a nod to InFamous in the form of picking your weapons. There is no save button but it seems to get it close enough when you power  the system back up.i could see certain people getting frustrated w/ this game. There is a lot of building up and explaining. The feathers to collect in the game can be a bit tricky even witht the gps you are given. You still climb tall places and synch your vision. There is the hidden blade and throwing stars as well. Ride horses to the next village and protect your remaining family.

It hews pretty closely to the previous version but with different songs (obviously!) and dancer graphics. The songs are a diverse mix -- from recent pop hits like Lady Gaga's ""Applause"", One Direction's ""Kiss You,"" Robin Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" to very out there ""hits from the past"" such as Age of Aquarius and Mungo Jerry's ""In The Summertime. One of the oddest was the theme song from ""The Love Boat!"" I would recommend perusing the songs to see if it interests you ... but I do have to say that sometimes the songs you don't think you will like dancing to end up being your favorite. You can also download newer songs (such as Katy Perry's ""Roar"") but I didn't get around to doing that.

As far as what is new with Wii U version of the game:

* Karaoke Mode: You can hold up the Wii U game pad to your face and sing along and get a rating but I thought this was not executed well and you can't hear yourself singing on the TV (which is probably just as well). Personally, I didn't think it added that much to the game other than if you enjoy seeing the lyrics displayed and singing along. (Or having others sing while you dance.)

* Party Master Mode: This was fun!!! One person dances while the other person ""runs things"" with the Wii U game pad -- picking the next dance moves and even changing the song in the middle. The only catch is that it is only available on a few songs (it is one of those features you purchase with your ""m"" points). My son and I really enjoyed doing this one -- though regrettably he made me do the ""Russian Kicking Dance"" way more than I wanted.

* Autodance: This was also fun but a little limited. You can record the action with the camera on the Wii U Game Pad and then have it play back with special effects that turn it into a little music video. You are limited to a short recording time and you need to think about how you are going to film as I kept getting the back of my son dancing, which made it a bit less exciting. Cool idea but not really executed to its full potential. You can choose to save your ""video"" and share it in the online JustDance community too but we did not do this.

There are other aspects of the game such as World Dance Floor (dance with anyone anywhere in the world) and On-Stage Mode (own the spotlight as the lead performer or rock out as a backup dancer) that we didn't get to use or make work. (We had connectivity problems getting to the World Dance Floor.)

A feature that might be handy for people who use this as an exercise tool is Custom Sweat Mode, which allows you to create personalized workout and track the calories you've burned across all songs. We didn't do this however.

Finally, there were the usual battles and mash-ups that you can earn for the various songs.

All in all, it was a worthy entry in the Just Dance franchise with some new features for the Wii U that are promising and fun but not fully integrated and well-executed yet.

So naturally I was very excited when I heard that a sequel was on the way. Now that I've played through it a couple of times (once each for the light side and the dark side), here are my thoughts:

The first thing that struck me about the game was how similar it is to its predecessor. The gameplay has been tweaked here and there with a few new variables thrown into the mix, but for the most part it plays just like the first game. The graphics may have been slightly improved in a couple of areas, but for the most part the look of this game is indistinguishable from that of the first. This is fine, though. I was hoping to see some better visuals this time around, but the graphics suffice, and the gameplay was solid to begin with, so why make any drastic changes?

One area in which this game falls short, however, is in the story. I do like the characters, the dialogue is well written, and there are certainly some interesting events to be discovered, but the overarching story was often vague and uninteresting. I sometimes found myself getting impatient in long exposition scenes because I couldn't bring myself to care overly much about what was happening. That never occurred in the first KOTOR. The ending of the game was especially disappointing in this regard. I kept waiting for the point to come where the plot would reach a level commensurate with the level of tension and anticipation that the developers were obviously trying to create, but it never came. The last couple hours of the game were sadly anticlimactic.

My other complaint is in regards to the game's difficulty, or more appropriately, its lack thereof. Even if you turn the difficulty setting to High, a decent player will find that there's not one point in the game that presents any real challenge. Your main character will have no trouble annihilating everything that crosses his path. The first KOTOR was too easy as well, in my opinion, but the problem is more pronounced in the sequel.

Don't get me wrong; it's still fun, and I certainly recommend it. After the brilliant Knights of the Old Republic was released to such wide acclaim, the expectations placed upon this game were very high, and the fact that it fell short doesn't mean it's not worth your time.

Bloodlines came two years after Super Castlevania IV and while IV has some better graphics and definitely some better sound quality, it has its own merits. Sure, you go kill Dracula... so what? Actually, the plotline itself is a refreshing change from the others. In this one, you can choose to be either John Morris or Eric Lecarde, which allows a different change of pace of having just one character to start off with (faintly similar like Castlevania III for the NES, except in that game you start with just one). The graphics are essentially good for the Genesis, so I have no complaints (YES, they're better than the NES).
Overall? A great game. It may not touch Symphony of the Night, but this game is ESSENTIAL to any Genesis collection. It may be difficult, but it's WORTH IT.

I also want to mention that you do not have to use the Amazon downloader, you can enter your keys at EA, and use their download manger to download the games. It took about 12 hours to download both copies of the game.

---UPDATE PROBLEMS!!!!---
To update the game, do not use the EA download manager (EADM) that installs with the game because it will make it so your game is unable to update the expansion pack, which I happen to learn the hard way :(

Follow the steps below to properly update the game:
1. Install Sims 3 (do not update)
2. Download the new EADM at the EA website.
3. Open Sims 3, and update
4. Install Ambitions and update

If you failed to do this, then just uninstall everything (select cancel to de-authorizing this computer) and reinstall in the order I listed above.

---MODS---
The base EA game is pretty lame. EA has this mode called story progression were they programmed the game to just randomly delete Sim families and add new ones. This means that one of your Sim families could disappear. Luckily modders have fixed this problem.

There are two major mods which are must for this game:
1. Awesome Mod, which add new interactions and fix a bunch of bugs that EA left behind.
2. Nraads' Story Progression Mod, which is a complete revamp of EA's crappy story progression. This mod will not randomly delete Sim families, but instead have Sims interact with the neighborhood based on their personality. This makes the neighborhood feel more life like, as NPC Sims will actually do stuff while your playing your Sim.

However, to use both mods, you must turn off Awesome Story Mode, which is Awesome's version of trying to fix story progression. I also suggest most of Nraads' other mods as they improve the gameplay experience.

---FINAL THOUGHTS---
Why 4 stars instead of 5? Well if it wasn't for Awesome Mod and Nraads' mods, this game would only have 3 stars. If it wasn't for EA nickel and diming us for every piece of Sim stuff, then this game would get 1 more star. If this is your first Sims game, you will quickly realize that Sims 3 and Ambitions is only the tip of the iceberg, and if you really want to have more options you need to buy more stuff and expansion packs.

Plus he can ""snipe"" things across half the map.

The only real management you need to do in this game is upgrade your structures, and buy additional units that auto spawn at set intervels.  So it's pretty much like an RTS but without all the micromanaging of units and their buildings and their upgrades.  The learning curve for this game isn't steep at all.  If you've played any RTS game, then you can play this game.  Really, all you need to do is kill opposing minions and take the flags, which helps you level up.

The real problem I had with this game is activating it.  There shouldn't be that much of a hassle just to play a game; I can't give this game 5 stars because of that.  I shouldn't hate a game before I play it....

The power and health regenerating pads are too far from where the fighting is, so if you chose one of the slow Demi Gods, you'll be out of the action for way too long.

4.0,False,"02 21, 2016",A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B00FRESY4I,D.G.M.,"Even though Im a huge Spider-Man fan, I held off on getting this game for a long time since, quite frankly, Beenox has yet to provide us with a truly exceptional Spider-Man game since they became the sole developers of the video game franchise. I considered renting this game simply to have the most recent Spidey game under my belt, but I eventually bought it anyway: Im that big a fan. And only a big fan like myself could find this game to be anything more than just average. First off, the story has even less of a solid structure than the first Amazing Spider-Man game. As is the case with most games based on movies, the story for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 video game is an alternate version of that in the movie its based on. Most of the focus has been removed from the Electro and Green Goblin characters and then placed on the games exclusive narrative involving Kraven the Hunter, Kingpin, and Carnage, with Shocker and Black Cat thrown in as well. While that storyline fares better, its nothing exceptional, and the way it ended was quite frankly underwhelming. An after credits scene did improve upon the overall ending by showing that more problems for Spidey are on the horizon, but since a third Amazing Spider-Man movie is now a no-go, this means we won't be getting a third game that will deal with this unfinished storyline. Not that its a huge loss, but its still somewhat disappointing.

The combat in this game was structured the same as before, meaning it aped the style of combat of the Batman Arkham games. The combat in the first Amazing Spider-Man was okay but ultimately very stiff and rather slow, while the combat in this game flowed much better by comparison, though it still was no match for the combat in the Batman Arkham games or even Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. On the downside, the context sensitive controls that let you perform certain actions like lifting debris off injured civilians or using a webline to pull levers from a distance were rather iffy and wouldnt activate unless Spidey was standing in very specific spots, which sometimes had to be further away than necessary. Aiming Spideys webshots worked well enough, but would also interfere with his ability to web up stunned enemies who were lying right by his feet. Furthermore, the boss fights were okay, but none of them were exceptional in any way, in fact I was able to beat all of them on my first attempts, which is something I couldn't even pull off in the previous game. The superior battles against the Spider-Slayer robots in the previous game were still the most entertaining ones, unfortunately there are no such battles in this game.

Now for the side-missions. First off, the side-missions are enjoyable enough. Spidey will do such things like finding bombs and throwing them out of the city and over the water, rescuing civilians from fires and accidents, saving hostages (who all look exactly the same for some reason) from getaway vehicles, helping the police deal with heavily armed criminals, and beating up thugs (of course). Thing is, as these random crimes pop up, you have a set amount of time to complete them before they disappear, which in turn lowers your heroic status. Miss too many crimes, and you will be branded a menace, prompting the citys Task Force to come after you with their drones, force fields, officers on gliders, etc. This doesnt really make much logical sense to me. For one thing, the Task Force was put together for the sole purpose of hunting down Spidey since hes pretty much always being branded as a menace no matter how much good he does, just like in the comics. So, for them to leave Spidey alone when hes actually fighting crime, only to suddenly start going after him when hes not stopping enough crimes, doesnt really add up. Furthermore, this sort of forces you to play side-missions at times when you would want to do other stuff like find collectibles or even play more of the main missions, instead of getting to side-missions when you're damn well ready to, which is the way it should be. Now, keeping myself out of the menace portion of the meter wasn't too tough at all, but it did annoy me when I wanted to just continue another main mission when a timer was running out on a side-mission almost halfway across the city.

Beenox clearly was trying to do something unique here: They wanted to make us really feel like Spider-Man by making us suffer actual consequences for not being there to stop crimes as they occur. Unfortunately, their execution needed lots of fine tuning. The part Beenox did do correctly, at least partially, revolved around the consequences of failing side-missions like, for example, not saving all citizens from a fire or accident. This would result in a negative news report from J. Jonah Jameson accusing Spidey of purposefully interfering with the police and firefighters who were attempting to handle the situations themselves. These should have been the only moments where Spideys heroic meter goes down and the Task Force was sent after Spidey, aside from scripted events; that would have made a lot more sense. Making some of the side-missions more challenging would have also helped in that regard and provided a greater sense of urgency.

Then theres the return of the Web Rush ability where you press the R1 button to enter a slow motion state, allowing Spidey to web-zip to the target location, interact with environmental objects, or web strike enemies. It works pretty much the same as before, thankfully, although I did notice it lacked the range it had in the previous game. The addition of a useful Spider-Sense function that allowed Spidey to spot enemies through walls and even see in which direction they were looking was a nice feature. I also liked the new feature of holding the down directional button for a few seconds so Spidey could use his webbing to patch himself up and heal any damage he may have sustained.  As for the webswinging, which used to be done simply by holding down the R2 button since back in the early PS1 Spider-Man games once upon a time, have now been changed up for some reason. Pressing R2 allows Spidey to shoot a webline at the nearest structure from his right hand, while pressing L2 lets him shoot a webline from, you guessed it, his left hand. This actually worked well enough, but I just don't see why that change was included to begin with, it seemed like it was added in simply to shake things up, making it seem like nothing more than an entirely unnecessary gimmick to me. At times, there would be moments where pressing either of the two webswinging buttons simply would not work, as if there was nothing for Spidey to attach a webline to, even if he had several buildings within reach of him, which I feel was an annoying defect of this new two button webswinging mechanic.

In the end, despite how negative my review may seem, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was enjoyable enough for Spidey fans, though still nowhere near one of the better Spider-Man titles, so it should be a rental at best for casual Spider-Man fans. Im hoping against hope that if Activision decides to give the green light to another Spider-Man game, which is hopefully not another movie tie-in, that they either go back to Treyarch as the developer, or that they have Beenox team-up with Treyarch to give us what could be THE Spider-Man game to surpass Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, and even compete with Rocksteadys Batman Arkham series. This is what I would consider to be my dream scenario: Beenox takes the combat system and Web Rush mechanic from this game, as well as the superior story elements from Edge of Time, then Treyarch takes the fast-paced, adrenaline rushed action elements and upgradeable abilities from Web of Shadows, along with the interesting mission structure of Spider-Man 3 and the better selection of random crimes from Spider-Man 2; Beenox and Treyarch then combine all those elements together into what I feel could be the BEST Spider-Man game. But alas, all that is nothing more than what I labeled it earlier: a dream scenario.",Yet another decent Spider-Man game and hopefully Beenox's last,1456012800,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

My only problem was that it really was not a 'DS' game, rather it is the same gameplay as Aria. The DS feature (outside of the ability to have a map on a screen at all times which was damn near essential) is the 'sealing' of bosses. You fight a boss and when its health is extremely low you are prompted to draw a symbol on the screen.

Imagine you masterfully fighting a boss, then you see the seal prompt and frantically grab the stylus, but before you can draw it, time runs out. You get angry, put the stylus down, and continue fighting the boss (even though you beat it). You then beat it down to the seal part, and try again, but mess it up. You get angry again, throw the stylus somewhere, and repeat the process until you draw with your finger.

Literally that is the one and only bad thing about the game. In every other way it is either equivalent or better than the gameboy advance Aria game.

Completely overhauling the series' archaic controls and trite puzzles, Resident Evil 4 ended up being one of the absolute best action games to ever see the light of day. Now Resident Evil 5 is finally here, and from a technical standpoint, the game is a sight to behold. These may be in fact the best graphics to be seen in any game on the market today, with beautifully rendered visuals that are simply eye-popping. The core mechanics from Resident Evil 4 remain intact here, as you play as RE1 hero Chris Redfield and new character Sheva; both of whom are investigating the African nation of Kijuju, and eventually are faced with hordes of infected villagers, mutants, monsters, and other nasties, including good 'ol Wesker. The game is loaded with enough balanced moments of action and tension, and having a partner only makes things even better. Seriously, adding a partner opens up some new dimensions to the gameplay that helped make RE4 so good, using teamwork to take down the baddies and watch each other's backs as well, which simply just makes the game more fun. The only true flaws of Resident Evil 5 lie in its online capabilities. Online co-op has it's share of problems, including not being able to exchange weapons with a teammate, as well as having to wait for the host to restart from a previous checkpoint or get to a new one before jumping into the action. Still, flaws aside, Resident Evil 5 is a sheer blast of an action game and a more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4. It isn't perfect and doesn't leave the lasting impression that RE4 did, but it remains a stunning technical achievement that delivers the goods, and with the promise that Capcom will be re-vitalizing the series once again in the next installment, the best may very well be yet to come.",A more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4,1238371200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Now Splinter Cell purest's have mostly criticized this installment for basically being dumbed down for mass appeal. I do sympathize with their point of view, and to some extent their constructive criticism is valid.

However, the revamped gameplay provides far more depth in my opinion. What was once an unapologetically conventional stealth experince, has now become a tactical 3rd person shooter/stealth hybrid. These new mechanics are visceral, and fluid in execution. The player can storm an enemy location with guns a'blazin like John Rambo. Or, remain quietly in the shawdows, identifying ambush points, and striking with deadly precision, all while remaining undetected. This freedom of choice provides a more engaging and balanced gaming experience.

Naturally, with the new TPS mechanics, the stealth aspects have been scaled down a bit. You can no longer drag enemies, or chose between kill or takedown. Also, whistling and throwing objects are a thing of the past too. However, the newly implemented ""mark and execute"" feature compensates rather nicely, and serves as an adequate replacement for the previously mentioned removed features.

People do seem rather disheartened that the single player campaign is uncharacteristically short. But to be honest, there is so much replay value in Deniable Op's that the shortened length of the campaign mode really just seems like an afterthought to me. Plus, there is a co-op campaign that is even more enjoyable. That coupled with single player story provides a decent amount of playing time, probably around 10-12 hours combined.

Conviction may disappoint the stealth enthusaist, but will undoubtedly reward the casual gamer looking for a fun stealth/action hybrid. The control scheme is relatively simple, but yet involved and engaging. There is a ton of replay value with this title, so the $60 price point is a worth while investment.",successful reinvention of the franchise,1273017600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",
4.0,True,"08 13, 2010",A2I0GM1GRDZ0IV,B000ZKA0J6,Richard A. Moore,"Campaign:  The storyline presents itself so much better than in SC1, its absolutely epic.  The single player campaign is a fully fleshed out experience separate from multiplay.  Being able to research different trees of tech in the single player makes it a very different game from multiplay and allows you to build to your playstyle.  Its going to take 2 or 3 plays to experiece all the units and abilities that customize each unit in the terran missions along with branching storylines. Finally finishing it today has left me with NO DOUBT that blizzard took the right direction in crafting SC2.  To squeeze in any other race and reduce the terran missions, tech, units, and story or try and add in a full 60 more missions with the same bonus material would have been a HUGE mistake.  It would have been like squeezing the entire LOTR saga into a 2 hour movie or on the other end try and watch it or read it all in one sitting.

CON: I do take issue with the fact that I lose the achievements I've been working hard for during a mission if the [] server in Cali or wherever goes down.  It happens and its a waste.  Considering that all other games I own that have single play let me earn achievements offline I consider this a step back and a half star deduction.  Take note that any ai skirmishes you don't organize online don't count for anything either.

Mulitplay:  I haven't been so anxious and pumped with adrenaline since my first multiplayer match ever on C&C Red Alert.  Multiplay excites like I thought no game ever could again.  [] is a lot lot lot friendlier place for non-hardcore RTS players like myself with seperate rankings allowing you to play similar skilled people, lets hope it continues to be such.  It also compensates for lag or is very smooth, either way I've had very little connection complaints.  Games with friends are easy to set up and quite enjoyable, just like the good ol lan days.  Speaking of which:

CON: SC2 has no LAN play and don't be ridiculous in thinking they're adding it in with any of the future STORY ADDITIONS.  If they don't have it in they don't want it in.  And if they want to do that its their choice but I do mark them off half a star for the fact that compared with older games I play at home with my wife SC2 isn't as fast(yet still fairly smooth) since it has to relay from a server out of state.  If it was just as fast as a 0 lag game I play over my network I wouldn't care.  I consider that another backwards step in technology.

DVD & Box:  Came with a nice little bonus, a wanted poster notepad of James Raynor.  Theres nothing like a blizzard box, but in the end the disk is only saving you the download time it takes to get it off the net, all your really buying is the game Key which you attach to your [] account.  Total Big Brother on this deal.  Like everyone says, offline all you can do is skirmish a bit and play the campaign without saving.  On the pro side you can bring up your account on any computer with Starcraft 2 installed on it.

Thankfully, Konami realized this and put in a good mix of songs, at least some of which you have heard (unless you lived in a cave for seveal decades...)  There're probably at least five songs on there you know.  You can always find the song list online if you wish, just note that some songs need to be unlocked by beating songs/reaching score goals.  The ability to add on ""Expansion Dics"" is also an interesting feature, but we'll see if this is a tease or if Konami will put out a good selection to make the 69.99 investment worthwhile.
The difficulty is varied as well, with different settings for strictness in judging, and how much you need to sing before one ""step"" is completed with a ""great"" result.
Appreciated greatly are also features for adjusting the mic sensitivity, although that could be fine tuned a bit to have less blunt settings.  Another feature that deserves praise is that you can select volume for the lead singer, music, mic, and how loud the song plays in your headset.
Now to the negative bits of the game.
One thing I've noticed is that one has the ability to mumble in the correct key and not actually sing audible words and still manage to hit combos.  While that might be a legitimate technical limitaiton, it's discouraging to have someone score higher than you, but not actually sing anything.
There could have been a much better story that might have gone with the ""Showtime Mode"".  I barely noticed that what Konami intended was that you are an aspiring singer moving up in the world of music.  Also the difficulty does not go up as you try to beat the venues, although it would make sense for audience at a stadium to be more critical at one at a party in someone's home.
Back to the Expansion packs.  Where are they?  Konami probably didn't want to confuse buyers by releasing the expansion packs the same date as the main game, but it would have been nice if they had a closer release date than December. (That is only assuming there's no delay in the release date.)

I remember seeing the commercial when the game came out, and thinking, ""Wow, that sounds so awesome."" But I'm not an enormous FPS fan, so I waited for a good price drop on picking it up.

The Campaign of The Conduit is pretty solid. The voice-acting is very good, even on par with Goldeneye (the Wii game, not the movie). The gameplay is standard first person shooter stuff, but a large part of the campaign is spent destroying enemy spawn points. It's fun, particularly when those aliens are well entrenched. There's no real comparison to be made, but I'd say the bulk of The Conduit reminds me of Gauntlet, if only because of spawn destruction.

The storyline is pretty good, and I was surprised by a plot twist or two. If you've watched a season of The X-Files or a few conspiracy theory documentaries on The History Channel, though, don't expect to hear any new ideas. The Conduit tries to deliver that shadow government/alien invasion story you've heard before, but in an enjoyable video game format. It largely succeeds.

The graphics look pretty good. Everything is pretty well detailed, by Wii standards. A lot of games don't have good resolution or whatever when you get close to an object, but The Conduit does. What's really impressive (especially if you've played Goldeneye, recently) is how good the online mode's graphics look.

Music: I don't recall being annoyed by it. The main theme of The Conduit sounds like it could be the intro to a sci-fi investigation show.

Online: Occasionally, it's hard to get a match going (at this point in The Conduit's life. Wii online, at large, is probably on the way out.), but once you do, The Conduit shows off again. It hasn't reinvented the wheel or anything, but the online mode is good. My only criticism lies not with the game, but with its players.

4.0,False,"03 29, 2012",A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B00007JZB3,Richard Baker,"The Good: Amazing graphics and effects, great sound effects, weapons look really cool, subroutine and level up system is intuitive, feels just like the movie

The Bad: Spotted cheesy dialogue, weapons consume too much energy, not enough enemies or bosses, Light Cycle races are far too few and shallow, no one's playing online, frequent bug crashes are annoying

The first thing you'll notice in Tron is the amazing graphics and detail to them. It really feels like you're in the movie and inside a computer. Everything is bright and highly detailed and look exactly like the movie. The only people who'll really feel and appreciate the detail in the game are people who know a lot about computers. There are many terms and words that refer to more advanced computer users, me being one of them, so I understood everything. When you first start the game you feel really giddy and it's just so cool playing this game! Monolith did a great job with the number of weapons and their design. The weapons look really slick and the ""subroutine system"" that is here is effective and nicely done.

You can find ""archive bins"" throughout the game that store permissions (which grant you access to move further in the game), subroutines, and emails that you can read that give you updates on what's going on outside the computer. The subroutine system is cut into 3 categories: Defense, Weapons, Utilities. You place them in a ring and every time you enter a new level you have different ""memory requirements"" which means you can equip more or less. You can also upgrade your subroutines through optimizers you can find which upgrade it from Alpha to Beta to Gold. Upgrading each step makes subroutines more powerful and take up less room. You can also upgrade yourself through a basic RPG type style. Then you have energy which weapons consume and so does downloading things.

Now all this in theory sounds great but this game just wasn't thought through all the way. Even though weapons consume energy they take too much so you're just left with your weaker disc all the time. The makes battling many enemies and bosses annoying since you're constantly dodging and restarting the level. Speaking of restarting there are NO checkpoints anywhere and you have to CONSTANTLY quick save every step you take. The story is also somewhat confusing and the dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times. There aren't enough enemy types in the game, and the boss fights are all same. Micromanaging your subroutines is also annoying when they get infected while fighting off the Corruption. You have to manually disinfect them and it takes forever if you are badly infected.

Now the errors and flaws are tollerable but they do get old near the end of the game. Speaking of that there are some bugs in this game that cause it to crash a lot near th end and as a result I couldn't finish the game (due to me quick saving right when it crashed so every time it loaded it reloaded the crash.) I also have to mention the Light Cycle races and they are few and shallow. There are 3 races in the whole game and even though you have power ups and all that its hard to get them and the races end too quickly. Half the time I wound up just moving around the grid until everyone killed themselves off so I could move on.

This whole game feels really neat in the beginning but near the end you just wish it would hurry up and end. I didn't get a chance with online play since no one was on but I'm pretty sure it would have been neat. If you want a snazzy looking FPS experience then go for Tron 2.0 you will walk away pretty happy.",The only good Tron game,1332979200,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

My only complaint so far is that the controls are really basic.  For the most part X and square are all you need to hit.  I know you can gather crystals and use your powers but it still mostly comes down to the two buttons.  It is kind of easy to die on Normal difficulty.  When you die it brings you back to the last checkpoint, so I find myself repeating often.  It makes the game more challenging but it will get frustrating for someone who just wants to lightly play through the game.

4.0,False,"03 5, 2004",A37975WRAR9MMB,B000099T1Y,Gregg F,"While this game is a sequel to ""Jak and Daxter"", there really are few similarities between the two. The first game was a pretty kid-friendly platform game where you walked around colorful islands and boards collecting orbs. It was a fun game, but didn't really have much of an edge. I guess you could compare the feel of that game to Crash Bandicoot.
Jak 2, on the other hand, offers a much different approach. After being tortured and experimented upon for 2 years, Jak escapes a castle within a dark city. In order to get revenge, he joins the underground rebellion in hopes of overthrowing the evil Baron.
I'm about halfway through the game, and I can tell you I'm surprised at how difficult some of the early missions were. For example, one of the first few mission has you being chased by a security tank, and it definitely takes a few tries to get it. Other boards were tough because if you get killed halfway through, you have to go back to the beginning, which can get frustrating.
To me, the most annoying part of the game is driving the hovercrafts around the city (I think this is where the game gets compared to Grand Theft Auto). The difference is that in GTA, driving is part of the game and integral to many missions. However here, most of the time you're just driving to the spot where the mission begins, so there's really no point in having to spend 3 minutes to get to the next board.
So, overall...great game visually, definitely challenging to play, very different from the original. However, driving around the city is tedious and kind of annoying.",Unique and unexpected (and pretty difficult),1078444800,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Considering that this game is brought to you by the same developers that delivered the massively awful Spongebob games that Activision previously ""published"", and that once again they're using Unity as they did with one of them, you would think that this game would also be just another terrible addition to Activision's dumpster of a lineup. That isn't the case, though.

Snoopy's Grand Adventure is a 2.5D platformer not unlike that of games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chibi-Robo-Zip-Lash/dp/B00Z0DNVZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chibi-Robo: Zip Lash</a>. It fills out the appropriate details one would expect from a game of this kind; you go through six themed worlds, run and jump on enemies and obstacles, go from start to finish to beat the level, and there'll be a boss at the end of each world. It's standard stuff, but it all matters on the strength of the execution, and on that regard, I believe Snoopy checks out for the most part.

The Nintendo 3DS version may have a noticable graphical downgrade compared to the console counterparts, but the environments can still be scenic and colorful enough to bring life to the levels Snoopy embarks on, and it helps that the soundtrack consists of nothing but relaxing jazz-like melodies that fit the Peanuts name like a glove. If there's anything regarding the aesthetics that irks me a bit, it's that the game seems to have some technical issues. Not-extremely-short loading screens are oddly present when going from stage to stage, and the framerate isn't really as smooth as on the console versions. Also, certain things like round obstacles tend to move on their own awkward framerate, but there are rarely any moments in the game where those objects come to play.

Of course, the gameplay is where everything matters, and Snoopy's Grand Adventure has it. Snoopy is satisfying to control (especially considering I can actually use the D-Pad), as his movements are fluid and he can have a few tricks up his sleeve; holding down B makes Snoopy helicopter his ears in the air for gliding, a la Rayman, and there are some costumes Snoopy can wear that grant Peanuts fanservice and, more importantly, extra powers like floatier jumps, a bash attack, a double jump, and the ability to freeze enemies into ice blocks.

Levels won't put up too much of a challenge per se, but the ride throughout is cozy and entertaining, as there is still a lot to like in the levels anyhow. Jellybeans are to Snoopy as coins are to Mario, and along with collecting up to 300 jellybeans per level (except for World 4, with 250 per level), there are also six Beagle Scouts to find. I personally didn't really bother collecting all the jellybeans or Beagles when I played through the game, but they are definitely there for replayability's sake (especially when taking in how you need to use some powers you obtain from later on in the game for some), and the levels themselves contain a variety of multiple paths to run through anyway.

The big issue with the game (which I can probably bet would be a dealbreaker for people that care about length) is that it is pretty short. If you ignore the extra stuff for replay value, you could breeze through the game in two or three hours. Considering how $30 would already be a somewhat steep price to pay for a game that small in length, I would definitely not want to imagine how anyone would have reacted when beating the game on the $50 Playstation 4 or Xbox One versions. DEFINITELY wait for the inevitable price drop if you consider buying this game.

But look past the length (and in the 3DS version's case, minor technical things), and you have yourself a platforming game that aims to please, which is absolutely way more than I can say for Activision's game lineup otherwise.",Not even Activision can ruin Snoopy,1446768000,35,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It will make ones life far easier in creating their own custom movies as it includes "" free camera movement"" which can take one ""scene"" and do many creative things with it. I'm not sure how many people are playing the game, but if the message board at LionHead are any indication, a fair number got the game primarily for ""sandbox"" mode that is creating films.

The game includes a fair amount of canned scenes sets and costumes and its not that hard to come up with something western, science fiction, modern or something else entirely. The canned scenes, that is two actors conversing or a guy in a chair smoking or two people whaling the living daylights out of each other plus maybe some 50 more  can be combined together with voiceovers, subtitles and music to form very interesting stories. Head over to Lionhead and one can see how marvelous and inventive some of these moviemakers actually are.

There are limits and some users complain endlessly about them: the actors in the stock scenes cannot be moved around on the stage and only follow preset paths, for example. But fortunately the "" freecam mode"" allows a variety of shots to be created from that one scene to be strung together in a variety of creative ways that allows deviation from the preset view to make that scene fresh and exciting. One should also invest in a three button scroll mouse to get the most out of the freecam, it can be ""emulated "" via the keyboard, but in my opinion, a ""poor"" emulation.

I started the game in 1920, then switched to sandbox but was overwhelmed by the sheer amounts of choices and decided to go back into the tycoon game and edit the scripts that the game produced for the movie shoots. These movies tend to be small, 3 scenes or so and once the custom script facility is obtained, provide fertile ground to manipulate and learn the basics of filmmaking THE MOVIES style without being flooded by too many choices at once.

Finished films can be uploaded to LionHead's site for viewing by others or shared on other websites as they can be readily viewed in Microsoft's Media Player.

Mods, that is, user added content can be also included to complement the stock art---a low end modder can take a picture, scanned it in and placed as a backdrop for a stage to set up a different location, maybe Paris or London. An artist might seize upon this to place their artwork in the game and use it as a commercial for an upcoming art show or explain their piece, for example. High end modders have gone so far as to create entire sets from retextures or scratch and added additional props and costumes to the game available for download.

I've had problems with the copy protection scheme of the game, and unfortunately, this did not go away with the expansion Stunts and Effects. When I tried to run the game, I got the perennial message that read something like""DVD emulation software in use.

Constant moments of going from God of War style arena fights to platforming sequences and lack of enemies sometimes for upwards of a few minutes.  The one thing that works however is the game doesn't over do it.  There are many different sequences which changes up the game pacing nicely, and for a 15+hr long game that is a plus.  Combat is very fluid and rewards you for mastering the block/counter system, you can unlock various combos which get enhanced by using Light or Dark magic.  If you die during a chapter you are returned to the last auto-save point, which are very generous in my opinion.  Do not be swayed by the platforming problems people complained about at launch either.  Yes Uncharted / Uncharted 2 spoiled us all with the platforming but Castlevania isn't bad at all. A tad more sensitive yes but the game is ultra forgiving; if you fall you simply lose some health and start right back on the ledge which you fell from.

Sound/Story: Amazing sound and effects I think.  The sound track feels like a refresh of the original classic OST's from Castlevania games.  Combat sounds are very fluid and have a nice flow to the audio; like the whizzing of the silver daggers as you toss them.  The storyline is fantastic.  It makes up for any problems the game has easily.  There are plenty of clues you get to hint at the ending yet when the final boss comes  you are shocked.  ** Don't skip the credits either as you get treated to an awesome 4min cut-scene **

Graphics/Presentation:  Amazing graphics, in fact some environments were just down right gorgeous.  Because of this however there is a frame-rate issue but it is minor on the PS3 and 360.  The detail in the environments is just staggering.  Game presentation was fairly smooth as well.  There were segments early on which could be annoying.  Bad camera angles that hide objectives off the screen, parts where platforming seems impossible at first due to camera angles (the objective is only visible when standing in ONE spot on the map..). However once you realize the minor flaws  you can easily prevent them by spending an extra few seconds of exploration (which rewards you often with extra crystals and items)  Titan battles, though very Shadow of the Colossus are handled nicely.  In fact they were awesome to partake in, especially the final colossus.  Merging grip timings, with platforming and those insane graphics just floored me!

Length/Replay: 15+hrs easily and that was on EASY mode.  12 chapters long ..  At first the game might seem a lil sluggish but after chapter 5 it picks up especially when Gabriel gets stronger and begins to solve puzzles himself, instead of relying on capturing beasts.  The game encourages replay also. after you beat an Act for a chapter, like 3-1  you can either continue to 3-2 or return to 3-1 .  In returning you can find crystals you missed, arks, attempt a difficulty trial (like beat the level in 3 mins etc) or simply replay it at a harder difficulty.  Many arks are put in front of you but just out of reach such as double jump needed, or long jump.  Perhaps a way to remove this pesky rock ?

Overall Score: 85%
I enjoyed this game a lot.  There were some frustrating moments with the bad camera angles (one spot in chapter 11 especially) and parts where the game had my adrenaline boiling for more and suddenly.. CHUPACABRA for like the 8th time and it just drained my enjoyment instantly, having to do a 10min puzzle just to get back into the action (the puzzle was actually really cool to solve though ^_^ )  Yes there are problems with the game, some lack of polishing here, a bad camera angle there... HOWEVER the sum of the parts equal to a great game.  You rarely see a game 15+hrs long give you such a great storyline and have such a great overall gameplay feel that changes it up often.",A new story for an old classic...,1290729600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Typically, a game on normal mode on the Xbox 360 version will last about 3 hours, but on the PC it would last around 12 hours. Also, there are not nearly as many different types of units and buildings as before. Nor are the options like treaties and trading nearly as diverse.

What I've always had a problem with Civilzation is that there really is no actual single player campaign. It's more of you rather play against someone online or a bunch of computers. Therefore, Civilization loses its edge after a short time.

On a positive note, the gameplay is smooth, the graphics are standard, and the strategy side is still very much there. There are five modes of difficulty and you can also download maps that change the game to give you a lot of money, have the barbarians be a lot more hostile, have the building be a lot faster paced, things of that nature. A pet peeve for me is that the achievemants were pretty easy to obtain and although AP don't mean anything in reality, I take pride in having 17000+ points. So I didn't mind earning about 700 AP in a week or two of purchase without trying.

Super Luigi appears as downloadable content for that game, even though it's a standalone title as well. The only advantage to getting it as a disc is if you need to save space or if you'd prefer to be able to resell it individually at a later time.

The game is classic side-scrolling Mario style fun in the same vein as the original NES games, much like all New Super Mario games. To be more precise, they should be calling these ""Retro Super Mario Bros."" because that's exactly what they are.

The Luigi game brings back nearly all of the levels of the Mario counterpart but remixes them into all-new designs that are made about half as long, but with slightly harder sections. It was actually cool to play both games back to back to see all the same familiar levels redone in completely new challenging ways. People who've played the first will be used to this enough to be able to do well, but the game may feel incredibly hard to those new to the series. As an expert gamer, in some ways I found this version easier simply because the levels were over so soon. Don't let the short length scare you from buying this, though. There are still about 80 levels, 3 star coins to find per level, multiple paths within the levels, and plenty of replay in going back to find everything you missed. At the budget price it's a pretty good value.

The main drawback to the game is just the quick pace of play if you're in the mood for something more laid back. This game is absolutely out to kill you at every turn. You need to be on your toes and ready for the most unexpected and occasionally frustrating deaths.

Some people are complaining about the time limit of 90 seconds per level. I do understand this complaint, but in completing the game I only actually died to going over the time limit two times, and both those times were my first attempt at a level. The levels are very short and all can be completed well within 30 seconds. In all honesty, for the length of the levels the original game's time limit was just as tight as this one's in some cases. Those levels could be 2 or 3 times as long but certainly did not give you that much more time. I nearly died of a time over more than once in the original game. The real problem with the time limit, if any, is just that it's indicative of the problem I mentioned above that the game has a crazy fast and unforgiving pace of play all-around. Some will love this, but if this sounds bad to you, consider a different game.

I do think this game and its predecessor are great for kids, despite the challenge. It's games like this which will really hone a child's reaction time and ability to think on their feet.

The essence of the game is to drop tanks and vehicles at designated waypoints and then fly around the place targeting the enemy and dog fighting in the sky. Your VTLs range anywhere from full size bombers to light fighter jets for scramble defense. The whole game is set slightly in the future so all the gadgets and planes look really stealthy and sleek.

I wasn't expecting it, or was expecting a game the to be good given that it came with the wii gun anyways. I was wrong.

I like first person shooters, old style though i guess, my personal favorites are Area 51 and House of Dead. So i was expecting something like that. Link's is better.

1- The graphics are great. I play on a HDTV set thats about 31"" so that probably helps. But the scenery is beautiful and rich, the colors are great. There are loads of scenery changes, each unique, and there arent' any glitches to it. The characters that you come across, are great, there are birds and other things to shoot at and each is detailed and great. So yeah the graphics are great.

2- the gameplay is awesome too, you have three different modes to play in, shoot, point around and shoot(i.e. you are able to go 360 and shoot.) and move and shoot, which is the best in my opinion. the boards are different with shooting quotas that take you to different parts in the board depending on your score. the wii gun itself is good too, the aim takes a bit to get used to but the response is good.

3- Drawbacks- its only one player at a time and there aren't two-player shoot-em-up modes. the only multiplayer option is taking turns. Also, some levels are difficult, but then again it adds to the challenge.

one thing i find rather odd are the constant reappearance of monsters.  You can never clean out a section of any given area without it becomming reinhabited by the monsters.  This seems to be particularly true after finishing the sub quest for that area.  For example if you have to go get a sceptor from some part of the castle, you fight all the monsters on the way into that section, claim the sceptor, and the majority of those monsters have come back to life.  This is great for experience, but not a likely scenario in the D&D realm.
The game camera is pretty good and is easily adjusted durring combat to give you the best vantage point.  I would have liked to see it go lower giving a more character eyesight perspctive, as it is now I mostly use birds eye view to see where the combat is comming from.
One thing I would have liked to see more is the design of the character.  You choose 1 of 4 heroes at the start.  Essentially you are either choosing class and get stuck with whatever race they assigned it, or you choose race, and get stuck with what ever class they assigned it.
The graphics are well done.  The play is smooth even with large numbers of monsters shooting and hacking at you.
Auto mapping is a very helpful feature and is quickly dismissed durring combat.  one feature the designers put in on the auto map which seems rather odd is the location of special objects.  This could be what you are questing for, or the person you are supposed to go talk with.  Its like having an oracle at your finger tips.
Replay value, well thats rather difficult as it is an RPG, and thus once you know the story, you know the story and location of items.  This is the same with most RPGs.  (but most folks know that before purchasing a quest adventure)
In short, the game is fun, the graphics are great, and if you are looking for a quest adventure this could fulfill your needs.

I have been using Logitech's G13 Gaming Key Pad but wanted to upgrade to a unit with mechanical keys and individual RGB lighting for each key.  This unit from Razer fit the bill nicely.  It is a smaller size than the G13 and has adjustments for the palm rest and thumb keypad.  All of the keys are reachable without having to remove your hands from the palm rest. It is also possible to program multiple key profiles for a single game with quick action keys to switch between the different profiles on the fly.  I also like the cloud based saves of the gaming profiles making them available on any computer where I am using the device, but understand for some forcing an internet connection to use the product is a deal breaker.  With my Logitech G13 I have lost all of the gaming profiles twice and never have figured out where they are stored so they could be backed up.  Reprogramming game profiles for over 700+ games was no fun and one of the reasons I decided to switch. That said Logitech software is a step above what you get from Razer Synapse.  Don't get me wrong, Synapse is workable, but you have to work much harder because the multiple device integration is not as tight as it is with Logitech Gaming Software. Example, I now own a Razer BlackWidow Chroma keyboard, a Nega Hex V2 mouse and a FireFly mouse pad. With Logitech's software the device integration is so tight that one profile is shared between each device making key assignments and game specific macros a breeze to manage.  The same level of integration is simply not possible with Synapse.  To do the same thing under Synapse, I had to create a unique profile for each of the Razer devices and reprogram every key.  Macros created in Synapse are shared between all of the devices, and while this does work, it is almost a disadvantage as it requires a special prefix to keep the macros straight between different games.  I have contacted Razer support and submitted several enhancement requests based on my experience with Logitech and they have agreed to implement a few of them.  Still all in all, this product was easy to install, is very easy to learn to program and the lighting options make finding the correct key very easy.  Also being able to switch key maps on the fly is a huge help.  Another area where Logitech's products have an advantage over Razer is in default game profiles.  With Razer you have to program each and every one yourself.  Logitech's game software will automatically detect hundreds of different games and import the default game profiles on the fly.  At Razer there are a ton of lighting profiles for interesting effects, but these are no help when it comes to configuring the device for actual games.  Last, one other area that Logitech does better is the joy stick feature on their G13.  It is a real joy stick and can be used as such in any game.  On the Orbweaver Chroma, they use an 8 position rotary switch.  It can be programmed to sort of mimic what the G13 can do but it is not quite the same.  I am finding that I hardly ever use this feature of the unit, while I used the Joy Stick on the G13 quite a lot.  I haven't sold the G13 yet and may end up going back to it, but overall, in spite of the concerns listed, the Orbweaver is a very nice addition to my gaming set up, and an advantage in games.  Oh, one other quick note.  The Orbweaver Chroma is much lighter than the G13(12oz vs 1lb 4oz). Some users may find it has a tendency to move while in game while the G13's extra weight avoids the issue.  A couple of other issues to remember if you are trying to choose between the two devices is that the logitech has a built in LCD screen that provides system information, game information and allows you to switch profiles on the fly as well as a on the in game macro feature.  With Razer you need to switch profiles using the Synapse software.

Smuggler's Run, thanks to early in-store exposure, seems to be the more popular title currently, despite being a bit repetitive and not quite as deep or original as Midnight Club.
There are many modes of play in Midnight Club, the bulk of which is the Career Mode.  You start out with the bottom-of-the-heap Taxi, and use it to roam the city looking for ""hookmen.""  Once you find one, he will acknowledge you, and then you must tail him as he speeds around the city.  If you successfully keep up with him, then you will enter into a race (that takes place at midnight, thus the title) against that hookman and any number of his ""homeys.""  The objective of this race is to hit various checkpoints in order, and then reach the finishing point first.  If you are successful, the hookman will reward you with his cellphone.  When you get a hookman's cellphone, you can then call him, challenge him to a one-on-one race (no marauding ""homeys"" to help him out this time) which, if you win, you get to use his car.  Each ""hookman"" has a different type of vehicle (sport truck, Latino low-rider, Honda Civic, etc) and each has strengths and weaknesses.  The taxi is very maneuverable, but slower than molasses, therefore you will want to challenge immediately in order to gain access to better cars.
There also a Cruise Mode, where you simply take a car and drive around the city, no purpose or objective required (basically to learn the map of the city), as well as an Arcade mode, where you just race against other hookmen for their cars (but you can only use cars gained this way in Arcade mode).  The various ""hookmen"" are all very colorful and have a lot to say when you race them (including a dash of the old profanity), the cars are well-rendered in the style of San Francisco Rush, i.e. sorta arcade-ish, but detailed enough to know what they are.  There are only 2 environments in the game, New York City, and London.  Both have been replicated in detail from real city maps, lending a very authentic feel to the locales.  And both cities are HUGE.
I enjoyed the multi-tiered gameplay that almost forces you to run the gauntlet before you can get the prize (new cars).  It shows some creativity and plot-development on the part of the developers.  Is this game like Driver?  Yes and no.  The free-roaming environment is definitely similar, but Midnight Club is essentially a racing game, and not an ""evade the cops"" game (though the cops do show up in Midnight Club and will chase you).  Midnight Club is a very smooth, very laid back game that will challenge even the most hardcore gamer (especially on the later levels).  Once you start getting cars, you have to know which ones to use in certain situations (Straight course?  Use something with speed.  Circuitous path?  Get something with handling.)

No, but that's not a bad thing though as I welcome the brand new experience.  I understand with the new engine there will be some things not proper within the game, as core engine transitions can be challenging.

I will say that the game running on Frostbite is a great thing to see as the visuals are great.  I haven't encountered any of the buggy issues that were initially talked about at launch, and also the lack of emotional facial expression would be nice to see patched if possible (was done via update in Horizon: Zero Dawn).  When you have the emotion of the characters play out along with the story, it helps with further immersing you into the experience.

Being able to openly explore the galaxy created is great.  All the tools and weapons available too along with the archetypes for your character to level up with is cool.  Especially how you can switch them up at will is a great touch.  So I definitely enjoy the gameplay and the mechanics in the game.  I feel that it gives a good balance between the action and the RPG/exploration elements of the game.  There are many happenings on the side of the main quest that you can definitely get lost in and spend hours with exploring.

This is the first time I've played a new Star Fox since 2002 when SF Adventures came out, which I could only stomach for a couple of hours. It just wasn't what I was looking for in a Star Fox game. I never bothered with SF Assault and whatever other Star Fox games might have come out since then, so this is the first time I've really dug into a new Star Fox game since 1997. Wow. Jeez. I think I need to go lie down...

Overall I enjoy this game very much, it often feels almost like a remake of SF64 due to specific events and set pieces. The controls do take some getting used to, though there is sort of a range you can determine yourself in terms of how much you rely on the motion-control gyro of the gamepad. i.e. If you hold the gamepad as still as you possibly can, it's not that much different from classic controls. However there are occasions when it forces you to look at the gamepad screen instead of the TV, which again takes some getting used to. I was able to get a good handle on it after a couple of hours. I can't say I'm surprised to hear a lot of griping about the controls, it reminds me of all of the whiny fumble-fists who were never able to figure out classic Resident Evil controls. I agree that it would have been nice if these gyro controls were merely an option along side classic stick-only controls. The gaming industry should try to be inclusive to everyone, even sad troglodytes with very poor motor skills.

I haven't had a chance to try SF Guard yet, I'll try to remember to update after I have. The videos I've seen look like it's a fun little game.

First, realize that this set lets you play OLD versions of Street Fighter. So you have to expect lower quality graphics and sound than modern games have. It's a way to let you see the origins of this series, and to see how far the game has come in only a few years.

That being said, it is actually quite fun to play these games. Street Fighter II Turbo has a cartoony feel to the characters, who only move left and right against stationary backgrounds. You might get an elephant trunk to curl occasionally, but that's about it. The characters are reasonably detailed, and most are white males with an occasional girl or monster thrown in.

The moves are fun but have very basic animations. There are only a few voices that all characters share.

With Street Fighter III, you get a pretty impressive upgrade in graphics. The characters are much more anime-like with smooth attacks. The characters in general are fluid, with moving belts and fabric. The backgrounds are more detailed, with flying birds and moving people.  It is still a left-right fighter but gameplay is much more enjoyable.

The sound in the levels is themed to each level and gets you in the mood. I do get annoyed by the entry screen music which is loud and rappy, but luckily you don't have to listen to that for long. There are more women available on this version, and the characters in general are ones you can feel a connection with instead of looking at them as random pixel people. There are bonus stages and grading to enhance replayability. In one bonus stage, you beat up on a SUV!

While I only play Street Fighter II occasionally for historical interest, Street Fighter III is quite fun even in modern times and is great either alone to beat your previous scores or against a friend for head to head fun.

Thankfully I had ordered the dvd and not gone for digital download from Amazon. Still a new version of origin was needed and the total installation process took me around an hour including apparent updates/patches/fixes which were downloaded even before I could play the game. Not good work EA.........you screwed the installation process for this game real bad and really pissed us off.

As of the game............just two words.............Visual splendor......
An epic sci fi storyline which feels more like a hollywood movie than a game. Game play is fluid and shows improvement from ME2. The enemy AI looks good and combat is intense and more engrossing.

Let me summarize the goods and the bads of this game.

The Good

1) Focus on moral decision making that doesn't just focus on epic, galaxy-saving issues.
2) Improvements to player movement make you feel more like an action hero.
3) Wraps up a wide range of sprawling subplots without straying too far from the main story.
4) Detailed, natural backstory explanation for both series newcomers and long-time fans.
5) Enemies are more varied and aggressive in attacking your position.
6) Streamlined menus and interfaces for common tasks.
7) Epic details in terms of graphics and battlegrounds.
8) Great back ground music.

The Bad

1) Cover system can still be frustratingly wonky specially at corners.

Overall I give the game a 4 out of 5 simply owing to the issues we have faced due to the installation process. In terms of actual game play and fun factor, its a 5 out of 5 and surely in contention for game of the year already :)

Note: The Argus Rifle obtained as a bonus due to the pre order is not too big a deal. I received a better and more powerful assault rifle in the 2nd mission itself.

However, this game can exist because it's really good.  I love the fact that the action is pretty much nonstop.  The object of the game is to KEEP MOVING.  I like that.  Too many games feel like they're moving at a snails pace the way you're required to complete objectives and this results in a lot of ""stopping and moving"".  Gears of War is truly an action game, and a very good one at that.

The graphics are excellent, to put it simply.  If you hate the graphics well, you must not be seeing the same game as me!

The controls are pretty good for the most part, however, every so often I will accidentally do something that I didn't mean to do.  This can be a problem when enemies are on the screen ready to attack you.

I watched a few of my buddies play this when it 1st came out and I thought some things were cool, mostly not so much... But my wife got this game for me for christmas this year and I decided to give it a go and see what has changed since the much needed updates. And let me tell you! NEW ANIMAL! I played WoW for a year (multiple lvl 70s), and I'm still currently active on Final Fantasy 11 online (Since JP release, I have many fully merited lvl 75s and this game still hold up today, better graphics due to windower and PC and so on). I played a little of the other MMORPGs and my opinions are favorable for only 3 so far... WoW, FFXI, and now for AoC. Most of you have played WoW, and there sure are a lot of 13 yearolds on that game that never stop p!$$ing me off (I like the pvp scene, but d@mn the ganksters! Almost every Horde is a Rogue and every Alli is a Ranger). I like FFXI and the game is FOREVER long, as such, I still have not done everything this game has to offer in the MANY years I have been playing it. FFXIs lack of a real pvp system has sent me looking in other directions only to return anyways.

Ok, rant over... back to AoC...

GRAPHICS:
OMFG the graphics are Mind blowing awesome! I have an Alienware PC and I can select High on the graphics setting, but just for S&Gs (and for the sake of this review) I dropped them down to low and took a look... and its still really nice! The clipping plane does not seem to exist! You can see so far you forget its not real! Blood spewing combat is just sooo over the top awesome! The 1st time I hit an enemy so hard in the head with a hammer that the head came clean off and threw blood on my screen I giggled like a school girl! If you have the computer to run this game (mind you its VERY VERY heavy on the system useage) then youll get blown away by eye candy as well! I assure you!!!

GAME PLAY - COMBAT:
The combat system is ok, I havnt tried to map this with a controller yet or write any macros, both of which can be done, but so far the click-click style that WoW uses combined with striking direction isn't so bad. Its still kinda strange to me as I havnt had this game very long yet (as you can see by the review date) but it works quite well. Doing a nice finishing combo move in the direction that isn't being guarded is just pure carnage. Speaking of Guarding Direction... yes, you can choose the direction to be shielded from in a 3 layer system. Front, Left side, and Right side. Not too bad of an Idea, but I really cant see myself changing this from having 1 of each of the 3 shield directions on each of the 3 sides. Sure my defences are lower, but if someone attacks me with all their defence on the front and left, guess where I'll attack to? Seems fairly useless to have this, but I do suppose its needed as if you didn't have it, then the fun attack directions wouldnt be needed either. As far as the type of combat there is, you really have 4 choices and 3 sub choices in that. Solder; your heavly armored tank style jobs, Priest; semi-squishy healers/vampires and such, Rogue; your sneaky melee death dealers, and Mage; your not-so-sneaky magic wielding damage dealers (some REALLY neat stuff here, like necromacers can use your last kill against you!). Neat stuff. Great choices compared to WoW, pretty limiting compared to someone over lvl 30 on FFXI.

GAME PLAY - QUESTS:
Ok, heres where I cant give it a 5 star rating. Theres a lot of quests, no doubt. But, I don't really see any benifit in doing most of them. More often than not the rewards for them are a piece of equipment that your class cant use or its just some Gold/Silver/Copper/Tin that you really don't seem to even need. Heres a low level quest for example: This clothe maker wants 50 (yes 50) Aligator hides... Or how about another one: He wants revenge on the ""Picts"" so you have to go kill 50 of them. Well, when you run to the place that he wants them killed, you kill 50 and run back... just to get some 3 tin junk and a bit of exp for a reward. Why not just stay there and kill 100, and only run back to NPC the junk that drops off the slaughtered? The exp is just as fast and now you can practice your fatalitys for when you lowbie attacks you later.

OVERALL:
Fun. No doubt this is a lot of fun. From the Hooker that has me take revenge on some non-paying Jons to the bar fights (which some fools old review said wasn't in the game anymore! IT IS!) which resultsin my stabbing of a drunk pirate in the neck with a broken bottle. Good times. The mounts are neat too! You can swing an Axe off the side of your steed as you pass by an un suspecting target, or knock someone into oblivion with the tusks of a Mammoth (which I just got for free by typing /claim in the chat window. Not too fair to the seasoned player, but neither is me getting my spine ripped out by someone 20 levels over me.)

I'd say this game is a lot like a cross between 3 things: WoW's interface, Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion's graphics (actually AoC's are better, but theres nothing else out there to compare it to) and Mortal Combats sheer carnage and spectaular finishing moves.

5 stars Fun
5 stars Combat
4 stars Content
3 stars Quests
5 stars Graphics (iftherewas a higher rating for graphics this game would get it! NOTHING is better than this on a high end computer. NOTHING)

I think I'll be sticking with this game for a while, atleast see what end game level is like, bc WoWs is about as exciting as a turd in a punchbowl with the repetitive Instance farming, and FFXI becomes a time for your max lvl chacter to get new clothes or find another job to level (Sky, Sea, Ground HNM, and Dynamis)... I just can't imagine me not getting bored with it in a year. Atleast with FFXI (and this is the reason I keep going back to it) when you want to start a new job/class its still on the same character and you don't lose anything (yeah it becomes a gear storage issue) you keep your fame, your city rank, and everything.

I'm not going to go on here and say it is a World of Warcraft killer or anything, but it has some aspects that I like better over WoW. The fantasy world of Aion itself is beautiful. I was really impressed with the way the world looks. The character creation system for the game is very well done. The characters look really good and there are a lot of options. In World of Warcraft, you get one type of human body, but in Aion you can be skinny, muscular, stocky, short, tall, and lots of other combinations, which is great.

I like the crafting system a lot. It reminds me of crafting in Lord of the Rings Online. The crafting system has a level of complexity I enjoy, but it is not so complex that it gets on my nerves. World of Warcraft's crafting system is so easy it is boring to me. Also, WoW's crafting system doesn't have much variety, so WoW kind of fails on crafting when compared to Aion. Also, I like the crafting halls in Aion. I enjoy seeing other people craft while I am crafting. One thing I never really liked about WoW is that there isn't really any crafting halls. The cities where the crafting halls are have teleporters that make it easy for you to go to the bank and back to the crafting hall for a small money drop, which is really great as well.

The Player versus Everything (PVE) play is very well done and challenging. Some people have complained that there is a lot of grinding. I'm not sure what MMORPG does not have a fair share of grinding really so I think this criticism is amusing. Anyway, NCSoft has started doing bonus XP weekends to help out the casual players, and so far I feel this has helped with any slowness in level gains.

The character classes are very good. I've played almost all of the classes and each one has something to offer. I feel that some of the classes are harder to play at early levels than others. Warriors seem to be the easiest class to play. However, I think the gameplay gets somewhat easier the higher in levels you get, due to added abilities. I would say the toughest classes to play are Assassin and Ranger, but I have not played them up to level 20 and they might get easier at a certain point. I do not know for sure.

First, the good things -- this is an entertaining first person shooter game.  You have a nice variety of weapons, your enemies use fairly intelligent tactics, your fighting is very mission-oriented and follows a nice storyline.  The sound is amazing.
Now the bad stuff -- I was surprised at how poor the graphics were.  Despite some nice touches (enemy AI, facial expressions, etc.) much of the animation is blocky and awkward -- not even as good as on my PC.  You can't save the game until the end of a mission, which can mean a lot of repition (especially for the opening D-Day sequence).  There are occasional bugs and freezes that force you to reset (my favorite was when I fell through a city street and couldn't move).
My biggest problem was the controller.  It was very difficult to shoot anything.  I realize that no PS2 game will match the precision of a PC's mouse.  But honestly -- Half-Life's controller was fine and, even better, had a target lock feature.  The difficulty in MOH pointing was incredibly frustrating at times.  Here's a tip:  Try pointing your gun and then moving your body to line up the target -- it works much better.
One last comment to a previous complaint:  the sniper rifle does give you a good view -- you have to use the D-pad to zoom as it starts out at minimal zoom.

The graphics are fluidly animated for the most part despite some moments of choppiness, and controls are pretty tight for the most part as well, even though tagging in isn't always as easy as it sounds.  There are also a nice selection of bonuses to unlock, including extra characters, character endings, and artwork as well, which up's the overall replayability, and as mentioned before, the budget price doesn't hurt one bit either.  If you're not into old school 2-D fighting though, KOF XI won't win you over.  All in all, if you're a fan of the King of Fighters series or old school 2-D fighting in general, King of Fighters XI is definitely worth picking up, and the fact that it won't hurt your wallet only makes the deal all the sweeter.",Return of the King,1195171200,11,,

On one hand, they complain about piracy, then wonder why they have more piracy when they impose draconian steps to curtail it.

Red Alert 3 replays the original Red Alert storyline. In place of Einstein, to have the Russian Commandant, played by Tim Curry, who has been involved in more games than Gary Gygax. Using a Russian time machine, they kill Albert Einstein, presumably after he kills Adolf Hitler, setting the stage for a three way war between the Allies, the Soviets, and the Japanese, represented by the Empire of the Rising Sun.

Following the mantra of the previous C&C games, you run through a progressively harder series of missions, sometimes with a combat squad, but often with the familiar base system we all know and love. The storylines are entertaining, though as the title implies, the uniforms have shrunk by five or six sizes. This is strange and disturbing for two reasons. You're so busy staring at breasts that're barely contained by jet black latex suits that you miss your entire briefing, and when you replay the briefing with a strategically placed piece of duct tape, the briefings are really pretty good. Emotions and accents are a tad over the top, but the production values and immersion levels of the Command and Conquer series has steadily improved. Why they felt the need to try and improve sales by making the cutscenes strike of soft-core porn is beyond me.

They've also introduced the deputy commander, a second officer played by either a friend or the computer that maintains its own base and forces. While you can't control the other forces directly, you can give strategic orders to the other commander. This is a great improvement, as you can defend and send them on attack, though more likely vice versa, ensuring there is always a defense force without having to split your focus.

Aside from the neat co-op option that I just mentioned, theres nothing here that hasn't been seen before, but if you're a fan of the series, you definitely won't feel let down. The difficulty curve is a little step later in the game, but not so difficult to make you give up. Cutscenes continue to improve, and in-game mini briefs a more frequent, and make it feel more like a progressing battle than an attrition slugfest. Personally, I'm going to wait for the battle chest with the expansions that's a few months away, but I'm trying to think of my wallet as much as possible.

It has all it needs to be considered a good game, but also has some issues:

Graphics 9/10: Simply great and beautiful. The landscape looks as if it comes directly out of the movie.

Story 7/10: this is where I think hardcore LOTR fans will be divided from Mass Market customers. The story is a bit of a slap in the face for anybody who read or loves Tolkien. Your party is basically always 5 minutes behind the company of the ring. Especially at the beginning of the game... a bit too much for somebody but very appealing for those who would like to feel as if they were in some way part of the trilogy story line.

Sound 10/10: how could it be better?

Gameplay 5/10: Weird things go on in 3rd age.

*Monsters appear from nowhere while you go around on the 3D world map.

*You can only use three members of your party as you work through fights. Since your characters will become stronger as they use their abilities, the fourth guy you leave out will soon be so behind the other ones he will almost be useless.

*You can't cast healing spells while not in combat. At least I didn't manage to. So either you use items or your wait for a fight.

*Each character has a skill set. For example, the elf has healing powers. Everytime you use one of those powers, her ""spirit skill"" will go up by a point. Once you achieve enough points you unlock the next skill. Since you use skills in combat it becomes paramount to use the most possible everytime.

*No game economy. No shops. No buying and selling stuff. No random NPC encounters. Low feeling of being part of an ""alive"" world.

Overall the game is fun but it really is not an RPG. It seems that RPGs have gone down to define every game where your character grows during the game and you can personalize her. Not true. Role playing is about playing a role, and you really don't get this in 3rd Age.

Plus the fact you have no possibility of roaming freely the land, you don't buy and sell stuff, and every treasure you find is in a nice chest. Yes, chests everywhere: in Moria, in the Mountains, in Fangorn...always chests.

Bottom line

Buy this game if:

1) you are a LOTR fan, liked the movies and like simple RPGs.

2) you are LOTR fan and will own anything with LOTR written on it.

3) you mildy like the LOTR and you like fantasy.

4) you like ""simple RPGs.""

Don't buy this game if you were hurt by all the differences the LOTR movies had from the book. This game would kill you.

HINT/SPOILER: to gain ""specialization points"" have the Gondorian learn ""Company Grace."" This will give you a boost in AP (action points) every round. You need these to use your skills. Go through a fight and once you have only one foe alive, use the dwarf to cast ""stone shield"" on the Gondorian. This will grant him physical immunity for a while. Then use the Gondorian and ""taunt"" the last foe. Your enemy will only attack the fighter from Gondor. At that point just start using skills. Your enemy will wast attacks and you will gain a specialization point every round. Remember to have ""company grace"" always active and to recast ""stone shield"" once it expires.","Fun, but very mass market",1100563200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

The graphic smoothing option is really nice, and anyone familiar with emulators (not that I am) will remember the Super-Eagle modes in emulation. It basically takes the pixels and smooths them out, making it look like a flash game rather than a 16-bit pixel game. A good example is that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Dragon/dp/B000E7FTPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Dragon</a>&nbsp;for Live Arcade. This feature is eye candy for some, but others may want to just leave this option off. I prefer it in some games, and some I'd rather have the graphics a little pixelated because the feature smooths things to a point were it just looks to different. No sound enhancements, thank goodness!

The games all have individual options. For instance, if you like the graphic smoothing for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Golden-Axe/dp/B00002SVOJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Golden Axe</a>&nbsp;but would prefer to have Sonic in his true graphic format, you don't have to swap manually between the two. Another nice thing is each game has a save file, not a built-in save slot. So if I'm late for work and I'm on the end boss of Streets of Rage, I can save, quit, and load later.

While there's several really terrific games, including most of the Sonic games, the one thing that should have been added is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ToeJam-Earl-in-Panic-on-Funkotron/dp/B000035XKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron</a>&nbsp;series, as well as a few others.

My only big complaint is the lack of online play. Sure, lacking this feature keeps the games true to tradition, but c'mon! It's the 21st century!

This is the SEGA collection to get, although I'd have loved to see a ""Collection, Vol. 1"" so I could expect to see another one in this same category.

4.0,False,"08 30, 2009",AZVCNOOQK36DH,B001CRM3YQ,DryvBy,"Wolfenstein 3D was the first shooter I ever played and it holds a deep place in my heart. It not only made me interested in video games outside of platformers, it also inspired me to look at the history of World War II.

This new installment in the Wolfenstein series is a lot different from the previous games. For starters, you're not breaking out of a prison cell or out of a castle. Instead, you're in the middle of the war, helping resistance soldiers with their quest. When I first read the previews, the game seemed to be as if it were an open world, sort of like Far Cry 2. However, the reality is that while the game is pretty open, there's a lot of load times in between areas. One part of a map is the west side of town, the other is the east side. This was a bit disappointing since it is very possible to make a town that's very open world with today's gaming hardware. This is one of the let downs of the game, as in even the earliest of Wolfenstein games, the maps are really well thought out. The maps in the new Wolfenstein, while aren't terrible, just aren't as creative as you'd expect coming from the masters at id Software and Raven. One of the more disappointing things is the tribute to the secret areas by pressing your action button against walls. There are secret areas, but they're just not as fun to find since it's not a wall just pulling back to reveal a special area.

While the maps aren't as impressive, the story is very well thought out and fits perfect in this occult shooter. The architects have uncovered crystals that possess power from a Sun dimension, and now the Nazis have their hands on them. So this time, as B.J., you are on your way to uncover the secrets of these crystals and try to take down the occult once again. This story line is truly faithful to the Wolfenstein series.

One thing I've always been a fan of in these games are the weapons. They're a blend of actual WWII weapons, while mixing in a few 'what if' super weapons. The new gun, the particle gun (which instantly vaporizes enemies into dust) is one weapon that is incredible to use. Now, the weapon does feel a little cheap the first time you use it, but after you discover how limited the ammo is, it feels pretty well balanced for the game. You also sport a veil, a device that holds your power crystals for slowing time or seeing things in another dimension. All of the weapons, including the veil and the grenades, can be upgraded using gold that you find throughout the game. The upgrade system is pretty impressive. It doesn't just allow you to unlock everything you want. You have to find secret tomes and intel throughout the maps to unlock features for your upgrades. While this system is pretty fun to use, the weapons are a bit limited compared to other shooters. However, I don't think Wolfenstein was designed to be more than a typcial Doom-style shooter with an actual story to back it.

The graphics are a bit dated, but they're not bad at all. It's the Doom 3 engine. The engine still looks really good, has great lighting, and still impresses. It's not going to blow anyone away like Crysis or Killzone 2, but it does it's job at providing a smooth and sweet looking Nazi shooter. The framerates stay smooth throughout all of the action, even during switches between one dimension to another. I was pretty impressed with the sound quality. The running waterfalls when falling near your character on a surround sound system really sounds life-like. The gun sounds are most impressive, as they each hold a booming sound instead of the typcial light sound most shooters give.

Now, the multi player is where the game is a little messed up. The game is less inpiring in this area, and it really doesn't feel like they put much though into it. The maps aren't horrible but the whole system just feels a little cheap. When you come from games like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory: Wolfenstein, you expect that excellent experience to carry over. The game is a typcial deathmatch style game with a few objective maps, however, they just don't feel as strong as the aged 'Return to'. It's still fun in some ways but don't expect this to take the place of many better multi player shooters out there. There's at least a ranking system, which is always better than nothing.

If you're just looking for a relaxing shooter with classic gameplay (and then some), this is the game for you. If you're not into single player adventures, I'd wait until a price drop or at least until they patch up the multi player. But for those who don't care and just want a classic Wolfenstein Nazi hunting game to go through, this game will keep you busy.",A Classic Shooter Reborn,1251590400,8,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},
4.0,False,"02 17, 2015",A25HPQFRP7K6VT,B00QJUVY7S,Dustin and Kate,"Total War Attila is both a step forward and a step away from what I've come to love with the Total War Series. I've been a fan of the series playing every game since Total War Medieval. I'm also a fan of grand strategy games as a genre and have played many different iterations from my first love of Star Wars Rebellion to modern iterations like Total War Rome II and Hearts of Iron III. Through all those games I've followed a methodical plan of action. Secure a resource base, research technologies and send out a large force to secure and hold territory. Total War Attila doesn't let me do that. The game held a fire to my feet and forced me into action.

One of the things that has always been more enticing than actually fun in Total War games is playing that random faction off in the distance. Waging small wars in my corner of the map. It would be fun, for a time, conquering my neighbors and securing a foothold. That enjoyment would fade as more often than not, once I secured my little part of the world I would be behind the computer. Having spent my resources on the small wars for a small empire meant missing out on the early game growth afforded by larger factions. Total War Attila does an admirable job of making that random faction off in the distance meaningful.

The game starts with the Roman Empire in decline and various factions vying for territory. Playing as the Geats, one of the Norse factions, the game turned against me quickly with famine and a harsh winter that meant I simply could not sit still. So, I gathered my forces, sailed across the sea and did what Vikings do, I invaded the British Isles. Within ten turns I was feeling the same intensity it took dozens to feel in Total War Rome II. With food shortages at home and forces suffering from attrition after the journey across the sea my options were to secure land or die. My first battles were almost as nail biting as a march into Northern Africa with legions of Roman soldiers to face down Carthage because there was so much at stake.

There are some notable improvements, if you want to call them, to the battle system to make it more realistic. It's the little things like having to actually have siege equipment to assault a fortress or having units be able to return to the fight after breaking. The combat, as always, is intense and a joy to watch up close.

One of the more notable aspects of the game is the new horde system that allows you to pick up your faction and move it. You uproot your civilization, losing all you've built up, and move your people into a new area in order to conquer and re-establish yourself. There are four playable factions that start out as hordes. I don't love the feature, but it really is a child of the concept of the game.

The game starts chaotically. In the north harsh winters grip the land forcing the Norse to move south to not starve. Nomadic hordes are moving in from the east to attack the crumbling Roman Empire. The game is very much in flux and, unless you're playing as one of the three established factions (the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire, or the Sassanid Empire) you are pushed to move either from others moving into your territory or harsh environments. I experimented with the horde mechanics, but I'm admittedly a settle and build up type of player so I played intentionally trying to not have to use them as one of the Norse factions. It can be done but it requires building up in other areas to support the motherland, so to speak.

The menus and interfaces are much improved from previous iterations. After the initial confusion from years of Rome II's interfaces I grew to like the much more accessible UI.
There is a much more in depth internal political system that those who have played Crusader Kings would recognize, albeit in a lighter version. The system is more in depth than in Rome II and I felt like I was in a precarious position quite often trying to maintain loyalty among my members and still retain the influence. Rather than the fairly basic senatorial system in Rome II there is a dual system of dominion and control. Dominion is your influence over the people of your faction while control is how the elite view you and can be lost or gained through political intrigue. Influence is spent on political intrigue to further your goals or secure loyalty.

The game looks great and sounds great. It's a joy to watch the battles unfold and the campaign map is aesthetically pleasing enough to be worth looking at for extended periods of time.

Overall the AI does a good job, but can make strange choices. It will decline political treaties that seem favorable or offer non-aggression pacts with a large payment when Im not even close to them. Or it will park an army that could easily wipe out the defenders at a settlement a short distance from the settlement and just sit doing nothing for years.

I realize future patches will fix the problems so I won't factor it into my score, but at present, there are some pretty bad bugs, just like Rome II. The most annoying was when the game wouldn't recognize my video card so instead defaulted to using the default internal graphics card instead of my Nvidia Graphics card.

Total War Attila isn't the perfect game. And at the end of the day it may just end up being a novelty for me. I like being a plodding, methodical empire securing territory and defending it before moving on. What Attila is, is different. It forces me to play a way I don't want to. It makes that small empire in the distance playable. And sometimes, what you really need is something different. Im not still playing Star Wars Rebellion, after all. I would recommend Attila to anyone who enjoys grand strategy, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Total War games like myself.

Of coarse, nothing come easy. You encounter dangerous beasts, ghosts, and if you fail, death himself. You also have to solve mind-bending puzzles, which is the main appeal of this game. You have to rely more on your brains and wits rather than your sword. The game is quite difficult the first time through, and will definitely keep you busy for a few days at least.

For ED, its as good as a hotas set up can get seemingly.  More expensive setups may feel better, and maybe even have more longevity, but for just function there is nothing I feel I am missing out on.

For Star Citizen at first, it felt completely useless.  The flight stick wasn't precise enough and getting out of the stick's dead-zone alone would make me overcompensate and overshoot in Arena Commander.  But now, after a patch it feels a lot better - I have done nothing to the settings of the stick, or made any hardware modifications, the stick just performs better in terms of aiming.  Other than that, I would highly recommend a rudder peddle set up for SC also - controlling roll with the stick's twist action is very fatiguing and leads to (with me) sloppy flight and sore wrists.

Overall it seems to me to be a solid purchase so far, albeit I have only owned it for a month.  I wish the stick had more resistance and weighed more.  The throttle also kinda sicks near low and full thrust.

I use them mainly for gaming, but also to listen to music and watch films, though less so.  These Turtle Beach headphones are pricey (230 bucks as I write this), but they are --mostly-- worth it.  The big selling point is that they are completely wireless, and you don't need to connect to your gamepad at all, you can walk around while playing if you'd like.  The set comes with a wireless transmitter base, which connects to your Xbox via USB and optical cable (included).  The headphones feature a number of preset sound profiles, which process the sound input in a manner suitable for different genres: shooters, racers, etc.  The headset itself is nice and comfortable, though not as much as I'd hoped.  I have a couple of pairs of Sennheisers (with leather cups and fabric cups) that have a better fit, but that might just be the shape of my head.  With these, I find myself constantly wanting to tilt them back up on top of my head.  The sound is good, and they do the job.

PROS: Nice design, good sound, works as advertised.  They come with an optical audio cable, which I didn't expect.  The packaging is quite pretty, and seems to take a page from RAZR's packaging style.  You can use an included mini-jack cable to connect to any device with a headphone (3.5mm) jack, like a phone or tablet.  Battery life is quite good.  Mic functions quite well and clearly.

CONS: The aforementioned optical cable is low quality and feels flimsy.  I really, really, really wish this would be compatible with my PC (as a wireless headset with the sound processing, not just with the 3.5mm cable).  I think it could have been a great selling point for Turtle Beach, and would have enhanced its potential user base.  Maybe in a driver package?  The price will also drive away some people, and rightly so- it's a lot of money.

After you do the tutorial missions or whatever, it will throw you on to their online servers. This in and of itself isn't a con. I've actually found I don't really care one way or another about it, except you'll occasionally get dropped from the server and it will migrate you elsewhere, which takes 1 or 2 minutes. Sometimes it will resume right where you were but if you're in a race or something you can expect that you'll be in last place by the time it reloads, and sometimes you lose your current progess all together and you end up back at the command post or hideout.

My other con is load times when you go back in to a command post or hideout. I think that fact that this is so noticeable is actually a credit to the game. You get so immersed in what you're doing that you don't want to wait to get back to it.

Oh and some of the music is just god awful, but that's a matter of personal taste. Most if it's fine though.

Aside from those things it's a great game. I've played both as a cop and a racer and they both bring a unique experience to the table though I personally prefer the racer. Getting busted has a lot more risk which makes it more exciting and I like the upgrade options only available to racer.

This is the first Need for Speed game I've played so I can't compare it to others in the franchise, but it's gorgeous graphically and it's not skimpy with surround sound. You can hear cars zipping past around you.

4.0,False,"05 28, 2008",A1H4KGCID2M1U3,B000SFK0T8,Layna,"My favorite arcade driving games are Burnout 2 & 3 - you crash like real life, the point is to avoid hitting anything (except AI cars), but celebrates your mistakes w/spectacular results so you don't mind. Crashing can happen a lot since there's always plenty of traffic to run into & they do have great AI traffic that try to get out of your way which can make you crash more. It's real, but it's intention is fun unlike Need for Speed series which takes themselves too seriously & the performance upgrades can be a pain.
Other driving games I have rented: Excite truck, Hot wheels, Cars, NFS: Carbon & Emergency Heroes.
Excite truck -
has better graphics, one of the best, great controls, but you spend 1/3 of the time in the AIR. ""Look, ma, I'm flying, I'm FLYING!!!"" It's an arcade, yes, but no truck can do 1080 spins in the air or be 500 ft. in the air & land w/o a problem. The driving while on the ground was superb though. Several camera angles. The mini game where you go through gates is the only time you're not constantly in the air & it's much more realistic. Has great speed feel & content feeling that you're going to crash any second. Also has invincible cards so you can drive through trees or pick things up to change the landscape so you can go into the air more & rings in the air. Definitely not a sim other then how the truck responds to the environment on the track or when hitting things.
Hot Wheels -
easy to control once you get used to the tight controls in about 10 min, fun tracks, but only has the camera behind the car though if you flip, the camera flips with you like as if you were in the car. The cars fishtail a bit like real, you get to shoot at other cars by collecting real-life style (not cartoon style) weapons when go through orange rings or green rings for temporary boosts. The tacks are narrow w/many pitfalls or places to get stuck, your car reacts to all things in the road like dominoes, balls, markers, soap, etc. Graphics aren't bad for a wii. Does not let you get away with hitting things w/o being stopped & then have to fix yourself like 3 point turn like real life which adds true fair punishment for bad driving instead of easy plopping you back on track (though if you do a large fall, it will plop you back). Has different tracks, normal race, rampage, eliminator, tournament. Has even different levels of difficulty as you unlock more tracks, but even the first difficulty is hard enough.
Cars -
VERY loose controls, you really spin the remote to turn which feels more realistic, but it's too easy to win even on normal mode, not kiddie easy mode. When hitting other cars, they only call you rude or other horribly corny remarks. Too corny/sweet & the track is very dull (there's no other cars then the ones racing out on desert tracks). One mini game style of driving was totally reversed & made no sense which many game critics also criticized. Only behind the car camera. I still enjoyed the novelty of the tracks & it definitely captures the fun factor. On easy, even if you fall significantly behind, your car catches up very easily. Has quick race, eliminator, rampage (shoot down targets in allotted time) & tournament (4 different races in one game) type games each for the two different type tracks in each of the five sections on each level.
NFS: Carbon -
It's all at night which means no traffic, controls can be tight or loose, I used tight & I still couldn't navigate the very windy roads in the challenge races area. (Another friend had trouble even on four lane highways though I did not.) You can tell this game is a port from PS2/3 title & the wii tilt is tacked on unlike Hot Wheels, Excite Truck & Cruis'n. Uses the A button for ""over steering"" so you actually have a chance in ... of making turns. Several camera angles, more realistic of how a car drives w/fishtails, etc. Great graphics. But w/o traffic, with only 4 other cars it felt dull. NFS also has ALWAYS taken itself VERY seriously. It's intentions doesn't feel as like it's for fun as it is more a simulation for car/racing enthusiasts only. You can hit bus stands, paper stands, garbage containers, light poles, police cruisers, police car blocks & still keep going like you went over a soda can. Carbon is very serious/complicated simulation in regards to upgrades, etc. Carbon specifically uses helpers such as a blocker, scout & drafter that you can use one at a time which critics said none really did not help.
Emergency Heroes -
I reviewed it on that game's listings. Suffice to say it had great wii tilt controls, good traffic on the parkways w/decent AI but no physical damage shown. Cons are there are no other camera angles, boring gameplay except the pursuit mode, irritating, over the top narration/character acting & had too many bugs.

Cruis'n - ok, it's graphics feel from the 1990s, but it's still 3D which some textures on all the city, parkway, country roads. There is some traffic, much more then NFS series, but nowhere near like burnout. The feeling of fun & speed when you get over 80 IS there which is important & feels great. You have 3 different camera angles including hood & tight or loose control options. You have diff levels of tracks (of different areas of USA) such as easy, medium, hard & extreme & day or night settigns. About 12 diff cars? That show you speed, acceleration (how many seconds takes to get 0-60), traction & charge. You can upgrade by simply choosing ""spoiler"" for speed, ""engine"" for acceleration, ""Nos"" for nitrous (only allowed to use 3x max, ""lights"" for under board lights (gives more points when in air), ""tires"" for traction, etc. very simple upgrade style for easy quick plays. It's 1 player for Circuit mode to unlock tracks & upgrade cars for getting $ for how well you do. Arcade for 1 or 2 player & still earn $ to upgrade cars. I found it VERY easy for easy, medium tracks in cars that had decent traction which is most of them. Wii tilt is very responsive & taking turns was too easy because you rarely fishtail which is unrealistic. The speed when going 130-150 mph was a great, you could barely see what was coming up next like real life & almost too late. There is a woman's voice for beginning & to tell you to ""WATCH OUT!"" but it's cued poorly, sometiems after the close crash. There are great alternate paths (find yourself or see AI cars use) to take like going through skyscrapers floors & roofs of buildings.
Cons - too many bugs/glitches such as you can sometimes go through solid objects like bridge foundations like it was nothing & you flip in the air when hitting a car head-on which is silly. This is more a great fun game while still w/realistic tracks.

A good casual pick up & drive game w/o a lot of deep thinking career modes, videos or storyline or commitment (it has none). If you just want to drive on somewhat realistic tracks w/silly & fun play, w/o investment or take it too serious, get this. If you are a serious racer who loves NFS style, don't. If you like a more unrealistic arcade feel of doing other stuff, get Excite truck. The only major turn off are the bugs.","Fun game, has feel of speed, one of the better controled games for the wii steering but has bugs/poor graphics",1211932800,3,,

The game opens with the main character and the ""transistor.""  The transistor is a sword-like device that talks to you and provides the story's narrative (there is no opening cut scene).  The voice is eerie and very striking.  I ended up looking up the actor, Logan Cunningham, since the voice was just so impressive.

Game play involves running around a very strange, lonely, futuristic world.  Computerized creatures jump out and attack you.  You can fight in real-time or stop time and plan out your moves.  When you stop time, it takes a few seconds to use the transistor in combat again.  I like being able to plan out my moves.  The live action is very frenetic.

As you level up, the transistor gets different types of powers.  You place these into slots.  It's an interesting system since you can have one primary power in a slot and up to two secondary powers that improve the main power.  It's fun because you can experiment to see what works best for you.

Overall, I loved the story and had a lot of fun playing it.  I just wish it was longer.  I am replaying it so that I can have more fun experimenting with power combinations, but it's not as much fun the second go-around.","Lots of fun, but way too short",1407283200,5,,

The basic story line of this game is that you play as a child of an extinct Bente tribe.  His name is Tao, but you are allowed to change that.  He is one of the last of his kind and escapes to a new place where a legendary Monster Tower is.  This tower had a seal to keep the monsters inside, but that seal failed and all havok broke loose.  It is your job to climb that tower.

The Info

Tao's Adventure is all about fighting.  The character can hold on to a sword, or staff, and a sheild for defense.  He can summon mosters that he raised from an egg, and he has magic abilities.  The whole tower dungeon is based on turns.  That may not sound thrilling to some, but it is nothing like Fire Emblem.  YOu may move around freely, avoiding monsters and traps.  If you happen to run into one, however, you are obligated to engage it OR run away.  Your summons can aid you in your fights.  By beating monsters you grow levels and further develop your characters skills.  Your summons also gain levels. There are lots of floors in this tower, designed to keep you busy.

 Appart from the dungeon itself, theree is a fairly roomy village where you may purchase other weapons, upgrade weapons, buy other items, rest, eat, ect.  There is also a multiplayer mode.

The Good

1)  With the many floors to the tower, the game will last awhile.

2)  Monsters have been incorperated in gameplay.

3)  Graphics are pretty good

4)  It's an awesome RPG for anyone.

5)  It does a great job incorperating the DS's capabilities.

6)  There are lots of magic and weapon upgrades, and many monster summons.

The Not So Good

1)  It may not encourage you to play it again once you have beaten it.

2)  The dungeon may get repetative.

3)  Swords cannot cast magic.

4)  Casting spells takes awhile (maybe 10 to 15 seconds)

5)  At the save point to your Inn, two guys keep talking, which gets annoying.

6)  It requires too much use of the stylus.  Only movement may be used with buttons.

Overall

Overall this is the RPG to get.  It will be a fine expirience and should last awhile.  I liked it a lot and you will too.  Happy gaming!

4.0,False,"04 13, 2012",A1EN5P2WZKWER8,B001DI6O6C,Fiat Lux,"This bundle includes the three main GW campaigns - Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall.

I played GW when it first came out, and then, like many others, was seduced by WoW. Recently I decided to return to Kryta and Kaineng Center and reacquaint myself with the White Mantle and Kormir. Though the graphics are old (after all, the game first came out in 2005), I was surprised by how much fun it was to play.

Here are some of the features that differentiate this game from other MMOs:

  Firstly, it's a free-to-play MMO. This means that once you buy the game you don't have to persistently pay monthly subscription fees to play. You can buy additional items from the in game store, if you want to though, but if you choose not to, it won't much take away from enjoying the game.

  It's very story driven, in comparison to some other MMORPGs. The lore may not be as rich as WoW, which has had decades to develop - after all, the first Warcraft title (Warcraft:Orcs & Humans) was released as an MS_DOS game way back in 1994 - but there's plenty of backstory here for those who like their games to have lots of facets and dimensionality.

  Although the game is cooperative, you don't have to wait for a bunch of people to play - you can utilize NPCs in your party.

The way the game plays out in the game universe is interesting - since each dungeon is an instance, you don't have to hang around waiting for bosses and named mobs to respawn.

  Unlike most other MMOs, the ""warrior class"" isn't just a tank in GW, but can put out lots of DPS if the build is carefully chosen.

Is this a WoW knock-off, as some reviews have claimed? I think it has enough differentiating features to be different, but WoW rules this genre and it's hard to play *any* MMO and not compare it to WoW.

One factor that you need to consider before buying this game is that Guild Wars 2 is coming out soon, which uses a highly modified GW engine and will likely feature much improved gameplay, not to mention that the graphics will surely be better eye-candy in comparison to the original.",Even better the second time around?,1334275200,10,,

This is a great start to what I hope will be  a new, long-lasting franchise. As so many others have noted, SOM is a mixture of Assassin's Creed and the Batman: Arkham series. Running around the world is very similar to AC, and that is a great thing. You can scale cliffs and buildings with ease, or pounce on unsuspecting prey from above--or below.

The combat system is virtually identical to the Batman: Arkham series. Again--a very good thing. The animations are fantastic, and some of the reversals are beautiful. Even while fighting with a sword, Talion uses everything at his disposal during a fight. I've seen him do kicks, punches, even wrist-lock take-downs during reversals and counters.

The Nemesis system can be somewhat frustrating because it can make it extremely difficult to kill some opponents. While I'm certainly one for a good challenge, I think that some of the experiences can be just plain frustrating and take away from the game. There are opponents that are immune to ranged attacks, combat finishers, pretty much everything. It can get irritating, but it does force you to think through your strategies before you run head-long into a fight.

The leveling system could use some work. While I enjoyed most of the upgrades, I would have liked to see more, specifically when it comes to the rune system. In any case, by the second half of the game, you are VERY tough, and you feel it. I was consistently carving my way through groups of more than thirty combatants, including several captains, and coming out on top with little difficulty, provided I didn't have too many missteps with counters. There are also some very late game abilities you can purchase for your sword, dagger, and bow that are TRULY devastating. Unlimited executions anyone? Heck yeah!

As far as play time, you'll get plenty of it. I found my character almost completely leveled up by the time I even hit the second half of the game, and I'd already put in over 24 hours. Granted, I did more than I needed to do to progress the game, but I so much enjoyed stalking the world and taking down orcs that I didn't feel the need to rush things.

The challenge modes that come with the initial game aren't impressive at all, and I was really hoping for something more akin to the Arkham challenges--throw me in an arena with wave after wave of bad guys and let me cut them to pieces. Although that hasn't happened yet, I've read that such DLC is most likely on the way. If that is the case, I can see myself returning to the game time after time to blow off a little steam after a long day at work.

In short, this is a fantastic franchise. If you are a fan of the games I mentioned then this is certainly one of the best games you can pick up to scratch that itch. As far as One titles go, this is probably the best to be released thus far, and certainly in the top 3.",Great start to a (hopefully) new franchise.,1414281600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In this game you can upgrade individual skills but in the previous game you could upgrade the weapons available. I found the weapons upgrades FAR more useful than the character upgrades of this one. The storyline of RE6 is great! However even with a higher-end flat screen I found myself having to adjust not just the brightness in game but on my TV as well as this game is simply dark. There are only a handful of daylight or ""well lit"" missions and almost all of them are in the early Chris Redfield levels. We get it Capcom, these are virus infected people and they should be scary but turning the lights out on everyone only makes it seem like you want to make a ""haunted house"" like Disney ride, not a real ""survival horror"" game.

The inventory system having a unique UI for each storyline was clever however there's still (A complaint from the beginning of the franchise) an arbitrary limit to the number of rounds each ""slot"" can carry. That's just terrible and it's been a constant problem with the entire series. I shouldn't have to discard one item in order to pick up a desperately needed one. Capcom might think that adds some kind of ""strategic asset management"" to the game but it really doesn't. It just infuriates players like me who can't pick up the much needed pack of shotgun rounds because their inventory is full and they don't want to give up a green herb or a flash-bang grenade. Speaking of flash-bang grenades, who ever uses them? There are only a handful of situations where a player would EVER need them yet they are scattered about every level and serve almost no purpose other than to either take up inventory or in a completely rare scenario which is the only reason we collect them in the first place! Just get rid of them completely OR have them do some damage. Pick one!

It is a highly entertaining game but not without it's drawbacks and even though I've been griping here about what I feel are Capcom's shortcomings it's still worth what I paid for it because of the online features.

Even before Playstation Move came along, this game managed to create a standard controller-based game-play style that felt natural and fluid, and really made you feel as though you were the character in the game.  The excellent story, which involves a serial killer who preys on children, is totally immersive, and actually outweighs the action in this game.  You play as several different characters during the game, including the father of one of the kidnapped children, and your chosen actions significantly influence the storyline and ultimate outcome.  As mentioned, you perform a series of button presses and analog stick motions to control the character's actions.  The way that these are set up feels very real and does an excellent job of actually making you feel as though you are opening doors, lifting objects, preparing meals, turning the lights on or off, etc.  This may sound mundane, and some of the tasks may seem boring to perform, but you quickly realize that they only serve to add to the reality of the experience, as well as allowing the well-crafted story to shine through.

I was really excited though that while it ""can"" be an FPS, it can also be played as a 3rd person shooter.  I had no problems at all, I really loved that you can create and customize your own character.  I prefer to play as a character I create rather than some predetermined character which is usually a generic looking white guy.

Anyway, I was really pleasantly surprised by this game.  I took a risk on it, unsure of whether or not I would like it but I really did.  Theres good and bad though, so here's my thoughts, first the bad:

1. The main quest is pretty short I think and you can knock it out quick, but you don't want to because one of the drawbacks of the game is that once its done, the game is done.  There's no freeplay after that last main quest mission.  I would have liked to have been able to go do more exploration or quests after the final main one or even to talk to people afterwards to find out their thoughts at that point.

2. There's a real lack in different bad things to kill, I count roughly a dozen or so different creatures and that's about it and you see most of the different creatures pretty early on in the game, so there's really not a lot of surprises.  Further, I found I could kill pretty much anything I ran up against fairly early in the game, so the stuff didn't really get more challenging.

3. I think there's a disconnect between levels and experience.  Either theres not enough levels or you get thru them too quickly.  I found myself maxed out at level 20 maybe 1/3 of the way thru the game.  That meant that I didn't see any motivation or benefit really to continuing to do certain activities as there was no experience.

4. There's a real limit to how much cool stuff there is in the game.  Again you see the same stuff over and over and there's not a lot of rare items, nor do the items get better as you progress.  That would have made more sense to me, better weapons and armor as you progress and encounter harder and harder foes.  Also, because of this, I found myself with lots of lots of caps (in game money) with nothing worthwhile to spend it on really, this took away motivation to bother to gather things because I didn't need the money anyway.

5. I get that there's only so much they can do, but still, every house seems to have the same internal layout, the tunnels all look the same inside, etc, just the configurations change.  Its not a big problem, but its consistent with weapons, armor and creatures in terms of a lack of real diversification.

6. There's a lack of diversification of faces, maybe a dozen or two and so you tend to see the same faces over and over, especially on the raiders.

7. Shooting when you're not in VATS, especially on a PC is a little tricky, but not impossible.

8. I would have liked to have seen some romance options, but that's just me, a romantic at heart.

9. It ends kind of abruptly.  I would have expected the last mission to be a really tough battle royale kind of a ""the biggest test"" of the game if you will, but it wasn't.  That's consistent with the fact that nothing really gets any harder or more challenging throughout, it all kind of stays at the same level even as you get slightly better weapons or much better skills or attributes, really it just gets easier as you go so for me, the end was really easy and I wasn't expecting it to end when it did.

and the good:

1. I really enjoyed this game and felt sad when it ended, I think because it really does have a great story that draws you in and truly makes you feel connected.

2. The voice work is nice.  Liam Neeson plays the father.  Malcom McDowell as the President, both have amazing voices.

3. While more diversity of music and radio station choices would have been nice, I did enjoy listening to the music and news of Galaxy News Radio.  The old style music was a neat contrast against the wasteland.

4. The world is very big and the environment is beautiful and detailed.  I would have liked to have seen it be a fully usable/destructable world like in some other games, but walking around, especially at sunrise or sunset, this is a really cool looking place with lots to see, lots to explore.

5. Tons of little side quests ranging from small nothing things to bigger things, so plenty to do.

6. I liked the karma system and how people respond to you is based on that.  Its not something you set in a window like I'm going to have X karma and be evil, its more based on your choices which I think is how it should be.

7. VATS makes shooting pretty easy and the slow motion of body parts flying everywhere when you hit something is a neat bonus.

So for whatever shortcomings the game has, I highly highly recommend it.  It plays out more as an RPG (role playing game) than a pure shooter.  You're not just shooting at stuff with no reason, this has a real story and you're a character in a world that you feel connected with.  There's a bunch of DLC add on content too but I didn't buy into that.  So if you're good with 3rd person shooter games (or 1st person) like GTA, Saints Row, Dragon Age, etc, you may very much like this one.",Great Game That I Highly Recommend!,1319414400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For those new to the series, Mario Party 10 is essentially a collection of virtual board games, each consisting of many rounds of dice rolls, mini-games, and unexpected twists at every turn. The goal of the core game has 4 players (any combination of 4 CPU or human players) attempt to become the Superstar by winning mini-games and collecting items. It's a proven concept for fun and social gaming for kids and adults alike.

Similar to Mario Kart 8, Wii Party U, and many other of Nintendo's games, Mario Party 10 evens the playing field across all players so one person won't continually dominate every game. Just like MK8's Blue Shell, this is a good and bad thing. If you are mixing kids and adults in one game, it's nice to know the kids have a chance of winning without having to 'let' them win. But for competitive gamers like me, it can be frustrating to consistently win all the mini-games but still finish dead last (grrr!). Fortunately, the game is incredibly fun regardless of if you win or not.

One of the best features in any Mario Party game is the in-game store. It allows you to have something to work towards as you play through the various game modes and earn coins, drastically extending replay value. You can purchase and unlock new characters, music, harder CPU difficulty, vechicles, etc. MP10 also has a large list of challenges (a.k.a. achievements or trophies for Xbox/PlayStation owners) that give you extra objectives to work towards, and allow you to earn coins even faster.

*Mario Party Mode*

Mario Party is the main game section of MP10 where most people will find themselves, but there are definitely lots of other fun things to explore in the game, so try not to limit yourself to only this area. In here are the very large and creatively-themed gameboards you can complete on as a party of four.

One unfortunate deviation from classic Mario Party in this mode is that all players share one vehicle to traverse the board in a linear fashion. There is a beginning and end space with each game board, so you don't do laps around it as is common in previous Mario Party games. This isn't a game-breaking change (MP9 was similar), but it definitely makes it less fun overall to be so heavily affected by each player's dice rolls and events triggered, and feel less in control of your own fate. I was really hoping for the core game to return to allowing each player to move independently on a cyclical gameboard, which is more fun and more closely resembles pretty much every real-life board game. But fortunately, there is the smaller Amiibo Party mode which does operate in this classic MP fashion (more on that mode later).

Instead of choosing a set number of rounds which each end with a mini-game, this game ends when the shared vehicle reaches the last space. This makes it so you can't customize the length of the game by choosing a higher or lower amount of rounds. It also makes the number of mini-games played more unpredictable, and overall much fewer. Mini-games are triggered more randomly rather than simply playing one at the end of each turn, which is too bad since the extremely fun mini-games are the lifeblood of Mario Party. A huge negative side effect of this play style, which was also the case in Mario Party: Island Tour, is that games can be *extremely* short and unbalanced, ending in as few as three or four turns (and only 1-3 mini-games) depending on your dice rolls. The outcomes of the mini-games are also made mostly irrelevant with how many HUGE star bonuses you can get at random throughout each board. This is where it becomes very frustrating to win many mini-games but someone else is lucky enough to land on or pass through an area which gives you 20 stars in a single turn. With how few mini-games you'll actually play, it only takes someone a few lucky dice rolls to be guaranteed a win. Also, sometimes near the end of the board, someone lands on a Bowser space that redistributes everyone's stars evenly, completely negating *everything* that has happened through the entire game, meaning the person who rolls the next die will probably win simply for being the one to cross the finish line.

One nice feature is the option to choose your mini-game pack. You can use the default ""all"", or if you're whiny like me and hate the pure luck-based games, you can select the ""No Luck"" pack. Or for the less skilled, there's also an ""Easy"" pack.

There is also free-play mode which is super fun if you just want to play mini-games without all the extra fluff. You can choose from MP10's large variety of 4-player free-for-all, 2v2, 1v3, and boss battles. Or you can do the Coin Challenge mode which has you competing through a set number of mini-games to earn the most coins. This is also a lot of fun since it allows you to focus on the most fun part of Mario Party: the mini-games.

*Bowser Party*

This is a new mode that can be quite fun, especially as Bowser. It's basically an everyone-vs-Bowser mode where one person plays with the Wii U Gamepad as Bowser, and everyone else is teamed up against him. Since Bowser doesn't use a Wiimote, you can actually play this mode with up to 5 players (Gamepad + 4 Wiimotes), or substitute CPUs in as usual. All mini-games are special Bowser ones having the 4v1 element. Rather than collecting stars, players simply try to make it to the end of the board with at least one heart intact. Each mini-game gives Bowser more opportunities to take away your hearts. From my several playthroughs of this mode so far, I would say it's extremely fun as Bowser because it seems to be rigged in his favor, while playing as anyone *but* Bowser is still fun, but can be frustrating. If Bowser's dice roll is too low, for example, he gets a free re-roll *every single turn*. Some of his mini-games are especially deviant, but definitely offer a different challenge than your typical Mario Party.

*Amiibo Party & Amiibo Support*

This mode actually turned out to be one of my favorites. It features much smaller, rectangular boards, where you play with the *much* better, classic rules that I explained above. So each player plays as an amiibo (must scan them to NFC reader in gamepad), and you make laps around the board for 10 turns, with one mini-game per turn. Most stars at the end of round 10 wins. Exactly like the classic MP games! The various amiibos supported by MP10 each have their own themed board for this mode. They are all the same shape, but have different event spaces and other fun differences. You can collect tokens while playing that get saved back to your amiibo figure that unlock extra bonuses and boards.

Here are the supported amiibo for Mario Party 10:
Mario / Gold Mario
Luigi
Peach
Toad
Yoshi
Wario
Rosalina
Donkey Kong
Bowser

Any version of them works the same. So your Super Smash Bros Series Luigi and Mario Bros Series Luigi will both operate identically. You can use *any* amiibo though, even if not listed above, to get one free scratch card per amiibo per day. The scratch cards let you win a random amount of coins to spend in the store from 5 to 50 coins. Gold Mario operates similar to normal Mario but automatically unlocks a special gold token for that amiibo.

It is important to note though, that you can only store one game's data on an amiibo at a time. So you can use your Level 50 Smash Bros amiibo to play amiibo party, get daily bonuses, etc., but you can't save data back to it (such as unlocked tokens and in-game amiibo bases) unless you are willing to overwrite your Smash Bros data. Unsupported amiibo (for daily scratch card bonuses) are read-only so it doesn't matter if they have other game data on them.

One other thing I accidentally discovered, is if one player enters Amiibo Party with a Bowser Amiibo, it becomes a sort of Mini Bowser Party mode, where all the mini-games are 3v1 Bowser games. Definitely puts an interesting spin on your game!

The only dumb thing about this mode, is to roll your dice, you have to touch your amiibo to the gamepad *every single turn*. This was clearly a pointless gimmick to unnecessarily force more frequent amiibo interaction. You can also push A on the gamepad instead, but you *can't* roll your dice with the actual Wiimote that you play the whole game with. This means you need to keep the Wii U Gamepad close to everyone or pass it around each turn, when they could have just as easily allowed you to push A on your Wiimote to roll your dice instead.

*Bonus Games*

If you want a change of pace from the main game modes, there is a lot of fun to be had in the Bonus Games section.

Badminton Bash is simply a game of Badminton, but turned out to be a lot more fun than it sounded at first. Kind of like a game of mini Mario Tennis. Once you get the hang of how it works, it can be a very competitive race to 21 points, in either singles or doubles variety.

Jewel Drop was on okay one-time game. It's kind of like a Tetris/Dr. Mario style game where you try to match up colors of Jewels. There's not a lot of deep gameplay to it, so I played each mode once and moved on.

Bowser Jr. challenges felt like mini-games that found themselves on the cutting room floor from the main game. It is simply a collection of two 1-player games against Bowser Jr. One where you try to steal his hammer and hit him with it, and other where you try to jump under the block he's running on. There's no difficulty setting, so I disappointingly beat each one in under 30 seconds and felt no need to revisit them.

Minigame Tournament allows you to have up to 8 people play in a bracket-style tournament. With each 4-player round, only the top two continue. So round one has 8 people competing in two sets of 4-player games. Round two has 4 people competing, and the final round takes just the top 2 to decide who the best is. Pretty fun if you don't mind alternating controllers around and not having everyone be playing at the same time.

Bowser Challenge is a single-player mode where you play as Bowser in all his 4v1 Bowser mini-games, and try to take out the competition as brutally as possible. At the end, you'll get a rating of 1-10 based on how many hearts you stole throughout the 12 mini-games, and get placed on the high score list for the mode.

*Toad's Room*

Toad's Room is where all the extras are. You can buy stuff from the store, listen to music you've purchased, watch the credits, etc. It also has a photo studio where you can place character models you've unlocked in front of various backgrounds you can unlock and pose the characters for photos. I only spent enough time in here to see what it was all about, but I can see this being a fun extra for kids to play with.

*Conclusion*

Overall, Mario Party 10 is a very fun party game. If you have played and enjoyed other party games like Wii Party U, Nintendoland, Mario Kart 8, Wii Sports Resort, then you will love this one too. And if you haven't tried those already, I highly recommend those as well! Nintendo really knows how to make a good, social, party game. You can always count on Nintendo's games to feel high quality and complete, unlike a lot of my PS4/Xbox One games I've bought recently that have rushed release schedules and hit the market with tons of bugs. It's a shame they didn't add any kind of online functionality, but even if you're playing solo, there are many hours of entertainment waiting for you in this game.

Other than the share-a-vehicle nonsense, and wildly unbalanced main game modes, I really had no complaints about the game. The core of the game is still the mini-games, and other than a couple pure-luck ones, they are nearly all masterpieces that you can play over and over in Free Play and still have a lot of fun. While I do hope the next Mario Party game returns more to the series' roots, I can still say I enjoyed the game very much and would buy it again in a heartbeat. I would also recommend you pick up the bundle that includes the Mario amiibo, since it doesn't cost much more, and allows you to play the very fun Amiibo Party mode. Thanks for reading my novel of a review.

*Summary*

Pros:
[+] The core mini-games are all very creative and *very* fun. I'm surprised they can keep coming up with so many new creative and unique mini-game ideas.
[+] Many game modes to choose from. Some old (Mario Party), some new (Amiibo Party, Bowser Party, etc)
[+] Amiibo integration gives you fun new ways to play and use your amiibo figures; even ones not in the Mario Bros series
[+] The large variety of modes gives you plenty of party options. From single player solo gaming, to standard 4-player, to 5-player 4v1 Bowser Party, even up to the 8-player tournament mode
[+] Lower price point than most of Nintendo's first party releases, which is why you should opt for the amiibo bundle for the same price as most of their non-bundle games!
[+] In-game store adds a lot of replay as you try to earn coins and unlock more characters and items
[+] For the Xbox/PlayStation achievement/trophy addicts like myself, I always appreciate when they integrate some kind of achievement functionality into the game (called challenges in MP10)
[+] This is seriously a game for all ages, from young children, to fully grown adults!

Cons:
[-] Ditches the better classic gameplay style in favor of less awesome ""everyone-shares-a-cart"" style traversal around the game boards (except in Amiibo party!)
[-] Outcomes of mini-games in main game modes are rendered pointless by wildly unbalanced random events and bonus stars scattered all over the boards
[-] No online functionality.

The setup of the story is cute, quirky, fun, and at times even endearing.  However, it doesn't work too much to tie together the battles.  The main plot sort of arches over the gameplay, which are generally tangential subplots that don't contribute to the main story.

The battles are pretty standard fare, with the best aspects being the many classes, abilities, and items.  Lots of stuff to ""get"" in this game, hehe.

Graphics are very good.  Anime portraits are used to tell the story, and although most of the characters are supposed to be kids, they look rather metrosexual to me, haha.

Multiplayer for turn-based strategy is never very good.  And this one is no exception.  The game offers linking to trade items, but unless you have a friend who gets into this as much as you, I think this game will mostly remain a solo affair.

Yes, this game is very similar to last year's version.  Yes, it's the only NFL-licensed football game on the market this year.  It's still the best football game you can buy for your PS2 (or any other system for that matter)!  I went through college playing the NFL2K series (later ESPN) on my dreamcast, and was sad to see it go...but Madden is a very high-quality (albeit not ""mind-blowingly innovative"") game.  The formula works well, and they haven't tweaked it much...but just enough.

The Good:

+More in-depth player management (i.e. ""game manager"", ""defensive stopper"", etc.)

+Improved (and I mean, REALLY improved) running game

+Defensive playbooks have more variety, and require a more cerebral aspect to the game (although with a good defense you can still call a lot of questionable plays that work)

The ""Bad"":

-The standard Madden fare:  questionable player ratings, quirky plays (some are nearly impossible to stop when playing a human opponent), playbooks - while claiming to be ""team specific"" are gleaned from the same databank of plays (c'mon, my West Coast Offense Packers have many of the same passing plays that the Cowboys are running in Dallas?!?!)

All in all, many of the bad points have been present since the original John Madden Football for Sega Genesis (and the NFL2K/ESPN series as well).  It may not have progressed/innovated the market the way many would have liked, but that doesn't mean it regressed.  The bottom line is, if you liked the previous seasons, you'll like this one.  The Madden ""system"" works, so why overhaul it.  Update rosters, tweak the features, make it ""a little better"" every year.

It uses the timed level grind system that games like monster hunter uses giving you 15 minutes per round to hunt, explore, complete side missions, and the main quest.  All the while collecting items, and new monsters fight along with you.

Is the story interesting... well that's a hard one.  it balances on the edge of being ""cute"" and avoiding actually being a yuri game that it ends up not having any fulfilling dialogs or substance.  I mean the main maiden that your protecting works in a coffee shop at the hotel and that's her big character arch since she has to convince everyone that its ok for her to take care of herself... or is it really so the dev could put her in a maid oufit.

Good:
Grind Happy game
Pretty (I like cellshaded games)
Different monster layouts actually change the powers attacks and visual appeal.
Funny side stories like one about a cupcake that is always horrible.
Monsters- i like the each has a distinct personality and you can talk to them at the hotel.  Though most says the same thing over and over.
Fan service - minimal but present in odd places.

Blah:
Story - It never gets much more interesting then monster hunting
Weapons - all look different but don't change the play style in any meaningful way.  So i chose the best looking ones.
Frame Rate - for the type of game it's not bad, but expect slow down when there's a good few things going on.

Bad:
Most side missions are as boring as they come, and often i didn't even realize i completed them until i got back tot he hotel.  Many sight seeing one, that are for places you've already visited.  Expect a lot of the same same.  The most interesting one are the day missions but they are done through text blurbs and easily forgotten.

So i might be biased... like really biased.  I like anime based games, i like the style and i tend to enjoy the dumb repetition.  Which means i give this game a pass for things that I'd normally despise in more western AAA titles.  Now is it a horrible game, in no means, is it simply terrible? No.  Is it an interesting game that i want to know everything about like the Witcher games... no.  Do I enjoy going around collecting random things in the hope of getting a newer better monster?

The motion controls aren't that bad after you get used to them but really do get frustrating during boss fights at times. Though going back to boss fights after knowing what to do made the experience a lot less frustrating. That said I still wish they made the motion controls optional because they still aren't perfect.

Each stage has an alternate way of beating it which is very nice for replayability. There are also five medals you can earn each stage which are essentially hidden objectives which add to the challenge / replayability as well. They revisit old themes and enemies from previous games but they always felt fresh and different still, it wasn't just a copy and paste from an older entry in the series.

I haven't tried it with another person yet but the co-op mode looks like it would be a blast because one person shoots with the motion controls, while the other person drives the ship (And can also shoot but it is limited). This seems like it would take away a lot of the annoyances with the motion controls because you are no longer multitasking as much with two people in control.

4.0,False,"06 24, 2008",A2YUXSKRKFT1QL,B00113JSCG,C. R. Godfrey,"Okay let me first state that this is a thinking man's survival horror, not a balls to the wall action title.  You should expect exploration, puzzle solving, story, dark atmosphere and some scares/suspenseful moments.  Where this AITD differs from its predecessors is the level of story telling and the inclusion of some action sequences that usually start run of the mill casual and suddenly jump forward when you start to get comfortable, but the major action sequences are heart racing and challenging ( i.e. Racing full speed through a collapsing New York City while an primordial evil tries to tear the very street out from underneath you, or platforming your way around the outside of a burning New York sky rise while it collapses around you.).

As far as control goes, AITD has two different scemes:  FPS (which works fine) and an over the back camera (A little frustrating).  You can switch between the two at will, which lessens the hurt of the camera issues.  While fighting with a me lee weapon, the camera fixes itself behind your back, but it pulls back to give you a wider viewing area.  You control the me lee weapons with the right stick in this situation, pulling it one way, then another to get the desired swing; You can also lock on to a desired enemy in order to strafe him. This in my opinion is not too bad, and definitely a step up from traditional SvH combat.

The ability to combine items on the fly (Two sided tape, flamible oil) opens up a lot of combos for combat and puzzle solving (Take the taped oil, puncture it an toss it where you want it, then light the oil trail on fire)  This definitely adds to the strategy department here,and allows for creative ways to solve your problems.

The story telling is taken up a noche, and is on par with many of the current Gen games in that area, the graphics are beautiful, and the ability to finally bash down the infamous indestructible locked door that has plagued gaming for nigh over a decade or more are all nice features that update traditional SvH for the current Gen. The music is spectacular whether its your mood setting background for SvH segments, the sudden dangerous shift for fight sequences, or the Hauntingly beautiful choir music that sets the pace for the major action sequences.

What blows me away the most is the presentation of AITD.  Combining all the best elements of Survival Horror, dark atmosphere, rich story telling, mystery, amazing action segments, and some disturbing enemies, accompanied by one of the most beautiful sound tracks in gaming history, this game is a solid title that is a good buy.

This game is rather unique in that you often have to think of ways to get the Starite in each level by writing down what tool you need. Although inventive, this formula gets repetitive very easily. The controls aren't intuitive either. You would imagine that they'd allow you to use the D-pad and buttons like a side-scrolling game (e.g., Mario) except everything is done via stylus, even character movement. The music is aimed at a younger audience, the graphics are cute, and the overall gameplay is fresh but it gets boring after several sessions.

Pros: Graphics aren't cutting edge but they're cute and clear. The gameplay is initially fun and very inventive.

Cons: The gameplay became repetitious and monotonous after awhile. Sure the game mechanisms change frequently, but the solutions aren't always clear and the controls aren't exactly the best.

4.0,True,"01 18, 2016",A3DR01EHOO4JLK,B00KWFCSB2,E. Zamora,"Pros:
- Great building tools for Mario levels.
- Hours of game play.
- Addictive for both creators and gamers.

I enjoyed hours of level building trying to create some levels with puzzles, automatic completion, and so on. I also spent hours playing creations from other players. Some creations were very interesting, others were challenging.

Cons:
- A lot of ""troll"" and unfair levels online.
- Hard to obtain visibility for your level creations.
- After hours creating a level, it might be online for less than a month before Nintendo removes it from its servers.

The game has several nice level creations online, but you will find them after seeping through all the trash available, so, you may play something good or interesting after 10 crapfests. It can get boring if you are unlucky. The ""popularity"" system will make some levels rise above others while leaving gems buried. If you don't like a level and want to leave a comment, the level actually gets a star (usually, stars are used by players to reward levels that they think are good) which is counter intuitive. If you spend the time to use the level creator and make something, it has a high chance to get removed by Nintendo in less than a month because it didn't win the popularity contest due to the poor visibility.

Recommendation:
I got the game because of all the buzz around it. I think the game is good, but not great after you get disappointed by the hours spent trying to find good levels to play, your creations get deleted before they have any good chance to be properly played, and may reduce immediate replay value due to frustration. I think it is a good game to kill time by those with lots of it in their hands, and may even be a didactic experience for kids and teenagers.","Good game, but poor rewards",1453075200,,,

4.0,True,"01 22, 2010",AN81JUYW2SL24,B001O1OBFY,Dr. Speed,"Pokemon Platinum

I have waited over ten years to play a Pokemon game. I liked the idea of training your own army of Pokemon to do battle against other users or the PC. Pokemon Platinum doesn't fail to deliver, but there are some upsides and downsides to the game. First, Pokemon Platinum is not really a new game. It is a rehash of Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl.  Apparently Nintendo likes to do this with its Pokemon franchise. There are only 210 or so Pokemon you can catch using just the Platinum game. In order to catch all 493+ Pokemon, you must have access to the old GameBoy games and be able to insert the cartridge while playing. That  means if you only have a Nintendo DSi (like me), then you're up a creek without a paddle. But wait, you could theoretically trade with a buddy assuming your WiFi security is crippled to allow only WEP pass codes. If you use WPA2, you're up a creek without a paddle (again) if you want to use Nintendo Wi-Fi connection inside the game. It just won't accept a WPA2 passcode even if your DSi will connect (using the advanced setup for WiFi). Long story short, if you want to catch and train every single Pokemon possible, make sure you at least have the capability to load a GBA cartridge, have a buddy with access to the hardware/games, and use a crippled WiFi connection that depends on WEP passcodes.

The graphics are awesome in my opinion. I love how many of the Pokemon are depicted in a warm and friendly manner. Even the fiercest of Pokemon look relatively docile in the artwork. The sound and music are apropro for the game, while the controls are very intuitive. If you've played a turn-based RPG game like Final Fantasy, Pokemon Platinum will be almost second nature.

I took my time and was able to defeat Cyrus within 40 hours of gameplay. However, there's also the Elite Four of the Pokemon League along with other side quests to capture legendary Pokemon. The level grinding took the most time. I also do not like how I have to buy health replenishing items or status healers. Games like Oblivion have done away with the need to buy 30,000 health potions. Using healing magic or abilities would have been nice in Pokemon, or even health regeneration. Running back/forth to the Pokemon centers became a pain in the butt. Granted, the Pokemon game engine was developed more than a decade ago, but Nintendo could have put the effort to refresh it a little. I do not have time to play Pokemon all the time, so I delegated level grinding as a chore whenever I have to fly on business. The countless hours spent waiting at the airport and sitting on the plane are now put to use leveling up my Pokemon.

Pros: Awesome artwork! The Pokemon look very friendly, cute, and huggable. Great sound effects although they could have made it more like the cartoon using actual audio (Pika Pika!). I'm not sure how large the capacity of the DS cartridges is, but seeing how I can easily get 2GB-8GB SD cards that are  the size, it's a matter of Nintendo keeping up with the times. Simple combat interface.

Cons: Level grinding, buying health and status healers, and sometimes it isn't obvious what you need to do to progress the story. The menu system is often cumbersome - depositing/withdrawing Pokemon in Bebe's PC takes too long, saving sometimes takes too long.
You need to invest in the older games, a DS/DS Lite (not a DSi), and have a buddy ready to trade in order to catch every Pokemon or at least get their data into your Pokedex. Also make sure your Wifi is capable of inferior WEP security in order to use Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

4.0,False,"02 17, 2013",A1HKC4EVKTZWD9,B005THAX6K,Dr. Mambo,"Of all the games recently released there seems to be a unanimous disappointment by critics with A:CM.  I have to admit that I usually follow critic reviews from a few sources that I feel generally match my opinion on good/bad games.  Of course the sources that I like bashed the game to bits, which was extremely disappointing to me because of the great anticipation that I had for this game.  Because of my anticipation and my childhood love for Aliens, I decided to buck my trend and buy the game regardless of the critical disgust.

First things first this game isn't nearly the pile of garbage it's being labeled as.  The first and major complain that I must address is the graphical quality.  I've seen critics say that graphics are 5 years dated.  Not true.  The shadow/lighting effects are actually very good and help to enhance the atmosphere and create a sense of isolation and fear.  There are some really great sets, the majority of them being in the Xenomorph infested lairs where alien remnants are splayed all over the walls, ceilings,and floors.  One set in particular takes place in a hallway partially onscured by water vapor that is back lit by yellow light which creates a great effect of aliens suddenly appearing and hiding in the dense fog.  Character models for the most part look average, its the minor attention to detail (uniform personalization) that makes them stand apart from each other and create the feeling that they belong and fit into the Alien universe.  Of course not everything looks great, the Weyland soldiers are some of the worst characters ever created and evoke no feeling from the player except maybe stomach sickness.  Environments outside of Alien ravaged territory look bland and uninspired, thankfully these environments are few and far between.

The next concern to address is the gamplay, but  I quickly want to address the gun inventory that people are up in arms about. Ok, though it is true that you can carry 10 or so guns, you can only physically use two at a time when playing.  So in essence you get a primary, secondary, and handgun, it's your choice which 2 weapons you want as your primary and secondary weapon.  Also, big weapons such as the smart gun and flame throwers are not constantly available weapons, they are level specific.  Weapons are fully customizable (which is underwhelming) except for the Legendary Weapons you find.  Also, wouldn't it have been smarter to have legendary weapons an end of game reward or reward in some sort of challenge mode instead of just having them scattered about in corners of levels?  This would have made the pursuit of legendary weapons greater.  Ok back to gameplay...  Critics said gameplay is boring and severely dated.  I read many reviews before my purchase and in almost all favorable reviews there was one similarity and the was the suggestion to play on Hardened mode.  I thankfully took this advice and I have to say I have died a number of times from Xeno and human encounters.  The most frustrating gameplay element of A:CM is the developers decision to include resistance from human enemies.  I say this because these sequences when you have to fight your way through waves of Weyland soldiers are the crux of the game.  Uninspired, terrible cover system, poor shooting mechanics shine through, and just constant frustration.  I really feel that if these sequences were not included in the game and you solely had to fight Xenomorphs, critical response would have been more positive.  The positive aspect of gameplay comes with Xenomorphs slaying!  Critical responses has carved this game because of lack of Xeno Ai.  Adjusting difficulty level to hardened seems to help remedy this complaint.  The bottom line is they are freaking Aliens not Navy Seals.  When they attack they aren't going to take cover and blind fire, they are going to lunge quickly, strike hard and fast, scurry away into a vent or over a rail and repeat.  Xeno's ca. Come back to back in waves or strike unseen from the vents or railings in the environments.  Hardened version tends to make the Xeno's faster, more agile, and stronger.  Most importantly it makes their acid blood come into affect.  Armor is constantly destroyed and replenished based upon the range you slaughter xeno's.  A quick tip:  play this game like it was meant to be played:  slow and steady with the motion sensor, especially in the alien environments.  If you run and sprint and just want to blaze fire and bullets the game naturally will seem bland.  Slow it down, use the sensor, play in the dark with the volume up and let the music, sound effects, and lighting immerse you.

There are things that could have been better.  As I stated the human enemies should have not been included, to all up the appearance of Aliens when they burst from the environment, there should have been loud musical cues to startle you ala Dead Space.  Also ala Dead Space aliens should have had more random attacks in an attempt to make you play through slower in fear of constant guerrilla attack.  There could have been some treat things done with the acid blood that were not capitalized on.  Also, while graphics aren't horrendous, they could definitely have a little more polish.

This isn't the best shooter out there, and certainly isn't the be all end all quintessential Aliens game, but it's still a very fun sci-fi shooter, and if you are a fan of the Alien series, undoubtedly you will like this game for what it is and what it tries to do right.

Fantastic alien environments
Alien animations of climbing environments, crawling on walls & ceilings
Killing aliens is always fun
Shadow/lighting effects
Music and sound effects
Some moments of great sustained intensity when crowded by aliens

4.0,True,"08 25, 2014",A1V9PVRBO807A3,B00B98HG18,Joshua M. Biggs,"So another Lego game concerning Superheroes comes out, and you know I am all over it, if not immediately, then eventually, this game is fun, but is not the best Lego game concerning Superheroes, (Unless except your a huge Marvel Fan) to me Lego Batman(the first one) is still the genuine classic of Lego Superhero Sagas, where this finds it way somewhere between Lego Batman one and two. (Better then part two, but not as good as part one) Now onto the pluses and minuses.

+ This is the first Lego Superhero game to be launched on Next gen systems as well as portables, and older systems, as thus this is the first Lego game concerning Superheroes that you get to see truly next gen graphics, and boy is it good. You'll love the graphics here. (Note there was Lego Batman 2 on the Wii U, but to be honest, graphically speaking it did not look like a true next gen game.)

- Well as in Lego Batman 2, there are scenes where certain things blend in so well, that they are hard to see.

+ The number of heroes in this game is amazing, as well as villains, and characters in general.

-  A lot of characters do the same exact things, that others do, and some characters make others seem useless over time.

+ There is a lot of puzzles, some of which make you think.

- Well in general, none of these are anything you haven't seen before for the most part, WB and TT keep doing the same things over and over again. In addition, some areas are hard, not because the puzzle is hard, but certain things are just so hard to notice.

+ A lot of the team ups in story mode are cool, and having three, and sometimes four characters in a party is a awesome new addition to the series of Lego games.

- However there are a few team ups that get over used, as well as characters, and some will make you, okay whatever,

- In addition, sometimes your characters have a tendency to fall off the sides and respawn just to fall again repeatedly, never had this problem with Lego Batman, also sometimes the extra characters, especially the big boys like Hulk and Thing have a nasty habit of getting in your way and preventing you from doing certain things you need too.

+ The Music to this game is really good, and has a few different tunes from different movies.

+ There is a lot to unlock, including events, and battles, characters, vehicles, and various boosts, as well as different versions of certain characters.

+ The world is wide open to exploring.

- Well the Wii U version is not going to get any DLC apparently.

+ The off screen playing is really nice on the game pad, and the maps etc. are well done.

- Even after the Update there are still bugs in this game, though I think the update, stopped a lot of crashes, and various other things.

- Prepare for some Slowdown in the battle with Galactus.

= The sense of humor here is hit and miss.

+ The voice acting is pretty cool here. Listening to your characters talk is pretty cool too.

So in the end, this is a Very Good Game for the U, and well worth picking up, if your a fan of the Lego series, or a fan of Marvel Comics, or both. There is enough here to make you geek out, though it is unfortunate that the Wii U will not be getting the DLC others do. :(. Still a great game to pick up for the U.

Bugs I encountered so far while playing this.

1. In Asgard while chasing Loki, Captain America, fell off the side, and wound up walking apparently on the water below the bridges and what not, and Nothing could get him back up with the rest of the team, which was unfortunate, because I needed him to get to the next part. Ended up restarting from the last save point.

2. While trying to Skip the Intro where Galactus was eating huge Asteroids etc, etc. I skipped them, just to have no option for new game, load game etc. show up. Had to close out the game and restart it.

3. In the final battle with Doctor Doom, though I had been using the game pad the entire game, Thing suddenly decided to go every which way besides the way I wanted him to go, I had to switch characters and switch back to him, to regain control.

4.0,True,"06 27, 2013",A2NFYC8I1CF8Y6,B004S5PBM0,CanadianFreak,"I should start off by saying I had played guitar for 5 years prior to purchasing this game, I taught myself in high school. I started out playing Guitar hero and rockband rythem games when they came out and when my sister got a guitar for christmas she never used I picked it up and taught myself to play it in a year.

*Buying this game I had read about the problems people had playing it and took the chance for $30.*
I'll start with the features I don't like seeing as I only have a few (and that's the only reason people read reviews).

Cons-
1) The Menu. Upon starting the game you choose which you're playing, guitar or bass if you paid for the option to play it, you then move to a screen that tells you to hook the game up through a stereo or headphones via the audio cables. Then It brings you to a ""Rocksmith Recommends page"" This feature I initially liked, It gives you songs that it thinks you should play because it has skills you should work on, but this is not the main menu. To access the main menu you must hit start which brings up the options to choose a song to play, a riff repeater for practicing song parts, multiplayer(local only), and the song store. This is not so much a con as it is an inconvenience.
2) ""Rocksmith Recommends"". Though this starts out as a good idea the game constantly switches out songs making it hard to learn and remember those songs. They do give the option to set up your set list, because the rocksmith recommends works where you practice individual songs then play them all in front of a virtual crowd, however this changes every time you complete a concert and when you try to add songs they end up in a random order (ie. I tried to set up a set list to start in standard tuning and end in drop d but the set list changed to E,E,D,E,D,E,D... which isn't bad when i use an Epiphone but my Yamaha has a floyd rose and tuning it is annoying every other song
3) Note recognition. This is more of a problem You'll experience if your guitars harmonics are not set up properly and/or you have a dead fret/ fret buzz. My 1st fret on the 6th string buzzes due to the fret wire popping out a bit because of moisture, this causes a small buzz (barely audible) to occur and because of this my first fret goes unrecognized by the game and this gets a bit frustrating however this is a user problem not a game problem! I do wish that the game could have some forgiveness
4) Colours. After downloading some heavy metal song packs I've come to the conclusion that the colours get way too confusing when your in a solo and its best to learn them in the riff repeater(good luck) and ignore the TV. The colours are arranged in a way that makes no sense at first, seeing as i thought a ROYGBIV style would have been nice but now i see would have been more confusing. The Problem being is when you have a group of 16th notes coming at you its hard to see what fret they are lined with and at full speed this gets annoying but the riff repeater has a slow mode.
5) Riff Repeater. This Is a GREAT tool, only problem is the starting of any section you choose it goes through the section at full speed and every time you miss a note it stops and rewinds the song to the note you missed, which is great for slower tempo songs but in a shred riff its annoying because you just keep jumping back up to 15 notes every 10 seconds because you cant pick the beat back up. Once you get past this problem though its an awesome learning tool.

Pros-
1)The game. This game, flawed though it may be and late to the party with most rhythm games going under, is absolutely fun. I have no problem putting this game in and playing it 6-7 hours a session. The game learns to play at your level and adds things as it feels you can handle them. This is by far the best music game to come out ever and I am very excited for Rocksmith 2014

If you buy this game for xbox360 I recomend getting a cheap pair of turtle beach headphones and the audio cable adapter if your using an HDMI, If you play it through a TV you get an audio delay that causes you to fail because your mind wants to match the sound and your eyes want to match the TV .","Good game, some frustrating things (X360)",1372291200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It has a soft rubber coating with various textures that makes it feel great and stays put in your hands.  The addition of the dual multi-function wheels and headset controls right on the controller are also a great feature.  The wheels work a little like two light switches I guess. It's a mound with a nub in the middle, and you can flick either up or down for additional programmable controls, or push them in like a button.  Very easy to use, but also out of the way so you're not constantly hitting them unless you mean to.  Great design.

The D-Pad has etched commands for Titanfall, and for headphone controls, but they are pretty hard to see.  Not a big deal if you use them frequently.  This is a WIRED controller, so you have to keep it plugged in.  I get that it appeals to more hardcore players that want instant reaction, but the XBox one doesn't have any USB ports on the front, so you're automatically losing over  a foot of cord just by wrapping it over the top to play.  We recently moved our living room around, and currently the 10' cord was just long enough to play in a recliner with arms in a rested position, but would have been many feet too short previously.  That's a dealbreaker if you sit more than 8' from your screen.  Also, I should note that it took about a full minute after plugging it in for the controller to respond correctly.  The dashboard button worked immediately, but that was it.  I worried that it needed programming right out of the box, but after a minute everything worked as it should.  Weird.

Overall, the controller looks and feels great.  For hardcore FPS players, it's a home run.  Not allowing for wireless, causal play is a bit of a bummer though.",this controller does look really nice. It has a soft rubber coating with various ...,1479945600,,,

 Graphically this game is very impressive for the little sleek PSP handheld. another reviewer said that almost all areas look the same and are drab, this is true, however in the ""Ruins"" world you jack into, its very colorfull and very stunning visually.

 As far as gameplay value it was repetitive in the same way most other psp games are , for example, most people are saying that Untold Legends is just a hack and slash with minimal plot. It's true, however it is sooo fun that the minimal story doesn't hinder the overall fun. The same thing can be said for Coded Arms.

  This game is definately worth the money, i was very leary for my first hour or so into it thinking it wasnt, but that's just cause the controls take some getting used to. once you practice for a while it becomes second nature and that is where the real fun comes in.

 I'm probably 2/3rd through the game right now, and its pretty tough, but also a lot of fun, especially considering its easily the equivalent of a console game for you to play on the go. You just can't beat that.

Overall, I'm satisfied. The Old West feel is amazing. Absolutely love that aspect. Characters fit into the setting, and the DLCs add extra in-depth chapters. Warning: Don't attempt the DLCs at low levels. Wow. Starlight Drive-in at a level 3. Whoops. Huge mistake. And, yes, hardcore is...well...hardcore.

4.0,False,"09 26, 2004",A3K08KQKC6AQGE,B0001DI6FM,darkguardian2,"This is a good game. This is NOT anything like the demo version packaged with the DVD SW Collection. That version seems to have been an old version going back several revisions; even the controls and weapons are different. It takes you into the battles featured in the films and you can play any character except Jedi Knight or Sith. You can pilot X-wing, Y-wing or drive AT-AT or scout walker. You can also ride a Tantam but you can't shoot while mounted. The game starts with the battle with about 200 per side. You can come back to the battle after you're killed as long as there is a Command Post and you still have troops. The problems are few but noticeable. The dogfights are clumsy at best and the controls for the aircraft are inverted and takes getting use too. The troops can be ordered to follow you or hold a postion but they may not do so even when they acknowledge your orders. I found myself assaulting an enemy position alone after telling a group of soldiers to follow me. I've been in battles down to just me On Cloud City with only 4 or 5 enemy left and the game ends not letting me as a sniper to pick off the remaining troops and win the game. Very annoying. The Endor scene features speeder bikes if you can find one. Some of the weapons are limited in destructive power and on occasion will overheat or run out of ammo. A head shot should kill an enemy but it must be the very top of the head between the eyes. Very realistic though and enjoyable. I finished the campaign mode and now just play the conquest mode. Still not a game for Star Wars fans to ignore and a lot of fun. Update: After playing for about a 100 hours this game plays unfairly and even ""cheats"" by slowly converting a captured flag to your colors; enemys appear out of nowhere after clearing a small room; tanks on one side and nothing to counter it on the other; effectiveness of weapons, ie. 6-8 rockets to destroy a tank or 6 shots to kill an enemy; limited weapons to counter shielded droids; troops on your side don't give cover for you during assaults and shows no difference in winning the battle letting captured flags fall in to enemy hands. I found a group of AI just standing there doing nothing in a full fire fight. If I leave the circle of influence even for a second, the flag completely resets back to the enemy colors, leaving me to start over. The circle can be very small in some areas especially in the Rebel Fortress on Yarvin. I had to stand on top of the flag to convert it. And finally, when you ""Respawn"", you always have your back towards the enemy. I got killed quite a few times just trying to turn around to face the enemy. Still a game to check out when the price goes down.
To add to updates 6/12/05: Jedi can only be killed by pushing him into The Pit of Sarlec with you in a vehicle (Tatooine) or grenading him off a cliff or ledge in Bespin Rhen Var battle scenes.

It seamlessly installed the new version with its separate icon but, to my surprise, looked into the old version and extracted my characters and names, including myself.  The games themselves, as other reviewers have noted, are fewer than before.  On the other hand, the games look a little crisper and work slightly better.  However, the flaws in some games, such as chess, were not corrected. [The games will stop unnecessarily for some reasons.]

The game programming is wildly varied.  Gin rummy is skewed, the deals stacked so that you cannot win at the expert level unless you're a miraculous player.  I'm quite good but only win at a lower level.  Conversely, chess is written so that anyone can at least breakeven even at the expert level.  Once you understand the game, in fact, you cannot lose...

Here's a little help for you in re chess: if you play at expert level, which you should (it's not expert to say the least), it will not let you take back a move.  For learning purposes, that's a flaw.  HOWEVER, do this: goto settings and change the play level to a lower level (i.e. other than expert).  Then UNDO the move.

4.0,False,"06 5, 2013",A2CH7D7568YXJF,B009AGXH64,Sally,"Let me start off by saying I am a long time Nintendo fan. I started out in the early 90's with an NES, followed by an N64, followed by the Wii, and now the Wii U.

I love Nintendo for allowing backwards compatibility  on the Wii U and for allowing us to transfer our content from the original Wii onto the Wii U. I have to say this though, the instructions made it tough to transfer at first between the two consoles. I ended up having to go to a youtube video just to see how it was done and I finally managed to do it. Just make sure you have an SD card, as well as your original wii remotes ready (preferably 2 wii remotes if you have them. 1 will do the job, but that requires constant syncing and unsyncing between the Wii U and the original Wii console. If you have 2, then you just need 1 remote synced to each console, making it much easier and faster to transfer your content). Keep in mind, once you transfer your content, your original Wii is empty. Everything you did is now on the Wii U.

Now, let's move onto the Gamepad. The gamepad is an interesting way to play. I personally did not think I would like the gamepad that much (I am very picky when it comes to controllers), but I actually do find it to be quite fun to play on. Some games, like Nintendo land, have you use it a lot. Then there are others, such as Super Mario U, that give you the option to use the gamepad or the original Wii Remote. With Nintendo Land, you can do fun things such as tilt the remote to move your character around. Then there are others that allow you to use the gamepad to look around, almost giving you that full 3D effect in a sense. It's definitely different from any other console out there!

Furthermore, the gamepad makes navigation a lot easier in comparison to the original Wii. On the original Wii, typing on the keyboard required you to use the wii remote to point at each letter on the TV screen (this was a pain in the behind because it was such a slow process!!!). Now, on the Wii U, the keyboard is on your gamepad, allowing you to select each letter the same way you would on a tablet. This makes navigation so much quicker and a lot less frustrating!

The TVii is a good tool to have as well. I have not played around with it too much yet (I rarely watch TV these days anymore), but I have checked it out. I do enjoy the TV guide they provide for you on the Gamepad, allowing you to scroll through it and select a particular show you want to watch. If you already have a TV guide on your TV to begin with though, then you probably won't be as amazed by this feature because you already have it. Personally, for me, I love it because we are old school in my house. We just have regular cable with no guide, so having it on the Wii U gamepad is really useful for me.

Also, similar to the original Wii, you still have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube, etc. Again, these things are FAR more easier to navigate thanks to the keyboard on the gamepad now.

One thing that disappoints me so far is the lack of games. I currently play two games: Nintendo Land and Super Mario U. No other games really interest me at this moment, but I do hear they are in the process of making them later on in the year, which is good news. You can either be an early bird like me and get this console now, so that way you are all set and prepared for the new releases in the fall. Or you can hold off and just wait until the titles are available before buying the console. I personally like to be prepared ahead of time, so that way I'm not forking up all my money at once, but that is just me.

Lastly, I want to talk about MiiVerse. This was another feature that I did not think I would use much, but I actually find myself posting quite a bit on there. MiiVerse is a way for you to connect with anyone worldwide. You can share comments, start discussions, give each other tips on how to beat a level, etc. You can even draw and post your drawings. I have hand written messages on there, as well as typed messages, and some drawings. The pen that comes with the gamepad makes drawing very easy and fun. You can draw just as good as if you were using a pen on paper. It is that accurate!

Overall, the Wii U is a great console! As I said, it just needs more games, but the games will come as time passes. What we have now are just the launch titles. So again, either hold off and wait for the games to come, or get yourself the Wii U console now and just play your original Wii games on it until more Wii U games come out.","Love it, but it needs more games",1370390400,4,,

The Bad: Graphics could have been better, bug crashes and framerate hitches abound, no downloadable content whatsoever, weird control setup, no drifting, the world of NFS is boring

Two NFS games later Most Wanted is still fun and exciting. This is probably the first NFS that did new things since Underground 1. The big thing here is the Bounty system and the Blacklist system. You start out at the top and then a racer named Razor cheats and gets your pink slip dropping back to the bottom of the well. You have to climb to the top of a list of 15 different racers to have a crack at Razor again. To get to each racer you have to raise your bounty a certain amount and complete a certain amount of races. There are many race types here, surprisingly, and they are fun and keep things mixed up. You have anything from drag racing, to speed traps (which clocks the fastest racer), toll booth (timed checkpoints), to regular circuits.

The bounty system is really nice and fun since you have to run from the cops and as you smash into them and evade them your bounty increases. You can use Pursuit Breakers to get the cops off of you then you can find various hiding spots until your heat cools down. This in turn brings the heat up on your car and the higher the heat is the more likely you'll get spotted. The next thing is the big free roaming world which you, honestly, really won't want to roam much since it feels so empty and boring.

Thankfully EA put a jump to safe house option and you can get to races from a menu instead of driving there if you want. The tuning is really nice here as well and doesn't boggle your mind like Gran Turismo would. There are a plethora of parts, visuals upgrades etc. to choose from. The main gripes here is that this is a typical EA port and they left in some bugs such as framerate hitches and crashes, but they never came out with a patch to fix this issue.

It's an amazing game from all directions, including amazing graphics, tremendous sound, and awesome gameplay. If you never played it before, this game is strictly focuing on the action aspects of the series. Lots of jumping, slashing and running from enemies. No worries about using magic or RPG elements to slow the game down. This is do, or die for this vampire slashing game. This particular version of Rondo of Blood can be considered a remix of the original(also included). What's so great about it, Castlevania fans will recognize the remixed music brought back from many of the original Castlevania games including the orignal level theme from the original Castlevania on the NES!! A true fans dream of hearing this music all new and synthesized with the power of the PSP. Even better, when you unlock the levels, you can setup each level with each theme song you want to use for that particular level, now how cool is that???  All that with new updated graphics, sound, etc. Rondo's graphics are amazing, the 3D cutscenes look great and although the game is considered to be 2D like the classic Castlevania games, you can probalby say it's 2.5 with the 3D look it has while all the action is taking place.

 Word of warning, Rondo of Blood is an unbalanced game in difficulty with parts amazingly easy to get through and bouts of amazing difficulty levels that will frustrated casual gamers from the start. Replenishing energy is so sparse and the game makes you start levels over adds to the frustration. Even levels in the beginning will be test of ones patience because you're going to die, a lot. But the reward of getting through this game will be worth the price of admission because along your journey in Rondo, you can unlock probably the greatest game of all time, Symphony of the Night.

When you finally manage to unlock Castlevania Symphony of the Night (which by the way, is no easy task) this game alone would have been worth the price you pay for the game, that's how good it is. Before I get into the game itself, I have to slap Konami across the face not allowing people to play this game right out of the box. And considering it's right on the cover as one of the game choices, I was a bit angry myself when I turned the game on and couldn't jump right into Symphony. If you need to know exactly how to unlock it, there is a nice video of a guy on the youtube that shows you the path, that's probably your best bet unless you want to waste time looking for it yourself, because I will tell you, I would have never found it without knowing first.

Symphony of the Night orignally released in 1996 on the Playstation. It was kind of a rebirth for the series. Going back to it's roots with awesome action and incredible presentation.  Considered by many to also be the best orchestrated score for any video game, ever, is quite a statement. And considering the gameplay is almost as good, you can't really pass this game up.  What's so great about the game too is its' enormous size, it's a pretty long game, especially considering it's age, and once again, it's still considered by many to be the best adventure games ever. I actually didn't think the game would be awesome like it was on the PS1, boy was I wrong. The music, the graphics, the gameplay, it's all better on the PSP. Heck, they even redid the characters voices with all new dialogue.  You need to crank this baby up with some nice headphones, wow!  The game has an enormous amount of depth, the weapons, the magic, the things you can do seems unlimited and the amount of levels is astounding. Defintely take this game for those long road trips.

If you're looking for a PSP game that is worth money, you really can't go wrong with Castlevania Chronicles, it's three great games in one. I personally bought the game for being able to play Symphony of the Night in the palm of my hand, but amazingly, Rondo is very very fun too as long as you can deal with it's difficulty spats. Great sound, great graphics, fast load times, and 3 games in one. Sound good to you? Me too.","Pretty much a Castlevania's fan dream come true, in the palm of your hand!",1201651200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"04 4, 2017",A2X7TZYX35YTC0,B00IZAF9GM,n00bfish,"This is a fun, addictive rhythm game featuring the Vocaloid IA.  It is comparable to the Hatsune Miku Project Diva series but still manages to distinguish itself from those games in terms of the music, visuals, and mechanics.

It's very difficult to write a review of this sort of product because I suspect that if you're reading this, you already know whether you're a Vocaloid fan or not.  If you are, this is a great buy, and you'll have hours of fun with it, provided that you are OK with the fact that it's all in Japanese.  (This is an import copy and no English subtitles are available.)

Compared to Project Diva, the graphics for the PVs for the songs in IA/VT are much more subdued and abstract, focusing less on IA herself and much more on abstract patterns, lines, shapes and color to visualize the songs.  The gameplay is also uniquely different as the notes move in linear lines which makes it a little easier to keep track of them -- compared to Project Diva where notes fly in from all over the screen.

The production quality of the game isn't quite up to the very high standards set by Project Diva, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and there is some GREAT music on offer in IA/VT.  Most of all, I'm just so glad that this game gives IA her own time to shine.","This is a fun, addictive rhythm game featuring the Vocaloid IA",1491264000,,,

4.0,False,"12 25, 2013",A7OR4U27PHXTA,B00FNNQREC,Matt,"I downloaded this game off of Xbox live on Black Friday and have not stopped playing it since.  There are two maps you can play your career on, one is European and the other is American.  I chose American...

You start off with one field on your farm and a handful of low end, basic equipment.  Couple of tractors, an old combine, sower, tipper, etc.  What I didn't figure out till later was that there was a bit of each type of produce already in the silos.  So with your silo inventory plus your starter field ready for harvest you can get off to a pretty nice start.  Pay attention to your PDA as it updates hourly for pricing on the market and it will tell you where to go and get the best return for your product.  I found it best to wait for fields to come up for auction, which happens fairly regularly.  You can save significant coin this way.  For example a field that normally goes for $550,000 I got for $300,000 at auction.  Selling the produce when market demand is highest will allow you to build your empire and upgrade your equipment pretty quickly.

Here's what I liked most about the game:
-The equipment is rendered nicely graphically, for a simulator.
-You can play in real time, or speed up the clock which helps to get past night time hours and waiting around for crops to mature
-You can do all the farming work yourself, however there are also certain tasks you can hire out, which turns out to be quite helpful as your empire grows.
-Animals provide extra income and with the exception of cows are very low maintenance.  You can basically tend to these animals when you have nothing else going on.
-It's family friendly
-Lots of equipment options

Here's what I knocked off a star for:
-Limited equipment slots.  You can only own a very limited amount of equipment.  While this may be for realism, my stance is, I can build the bank account to over $5 million, but I can't add a few extra tractors, combines, or trailers?  So basically I can be a multi millionaire farming mogul, but there is a limit to what my inventory could be?  Lame.
-I can hire a worker to: seed, harvest, plow, and till....but I can't hire for fertilizing, baling, or foraging?  What's the logic there?
-In order to hire for harvesting potatoes or beets, it will only work with the most expensive equipment....otherwise hiring is impossible?  HUH?
-The tutorials are helpful, but there is so much that is unexplained.  For example, I STILL can't figure out how to sell the milk my cows are making or re-use their solid manure.  There are icons for help, but they are very vague and are not comprehensive.

Overall the game is freakishly addicting, and while there are a few items that frustrate me and I wish were improved, it is a very enjoyable game.  I remind myself that it's a simulator that was under $40 and that to expect perfection on what was undoubtedly a low budget game is a bit harsh.  I have seen other reviewers calling for multi-player....I disagree that adding it would add to the enjoyment of the game.  Why do we need multi player in every single game??  I think that having another person meddle with the planning & administration of my farms would be annoying.

**Update**

- As someone pointed out I have since learned that the milk is picked up automatically.
- The solid manure is next to the cow pen, just takes a little while to build up.  Had to wait on this to build up a bit before I delved into green houses since they require solid manure.

I have had, and continue to have problems with the gameplay graphics settings. After turning down my distance settings and other settings, the game is enjoyable.  However, there are still weird lag issues whenever a zombie grabs me or shoots their green goo. No matter what, it lags to the point of where it is extremely annoying.

The game's presentation is absurd, it's characters are inane and the action is just plain silly.  Yet, despite these qualities (or perhaps, somehow, because of them) Katamari Damacy is ridiculously fun to experience!

There just aren't many games like this one.  The goal is to roll this sphere called a Katamari over objects which stick to it.  Most of the stages have you attempting to make the sphere as large as you can within the time limit.  Other stages have you collecting only certain items within the time limit.  Such uniqueness in gameplay deserves more exposure and be should be cherished by more gamers.

The music is worth some praise.  It's inoffensive, pleasant and pretty catchy.  Heck, EVERYTHING about this game is catchy.

The only character with any personality is this 'King of all Cosmos' guy.  His design has to be seen to be believed.  It's like the developers got together and said, ""Okay, how can we make this guy appear as retarded as humanly possible?""  Seriously.

I should point out that my copy of Katamari Damacy has a flaw where the PS2 takes about ten times as long as it should to load data from the game.  I haven't been able to test it on other systems.  Personally, I think I just got a defective disk.

In a game like Battlefield 3, He can hear each sound distinctly and directionally, communicate this to his teammates, and destroy the opposition. The PX4 works with the PS4, PS3 and Xbox 360, so we can use this device with several consoles.

-Although the box boasts ""Interference-Free Dual-Band Wireless,"" My son kept hearing a hissing noise when there wasn't any game audio on. He looked up the problem and found the following quote on Turtle Beach's site under ""Hissing"":

""Q: There's a slight hiss coming from the headset. Is there a way to remove it?

A: The white noise should be no more than a faint hiss. This is an unavoidable artifact of wireless audio transmission/reception, and all devices using circuit boards and batteries will have some level of hiss well
below -80dB. It should not be noticeable when you are actually playing audio through the headset.""

-Due to the PlayStation 4's current software, the PX4 is not completely wireless for chat, and must be plugged into the controller. This means that the mic volume cannot be changed or muted EXCEPT from the in-system settings. Though my son doesn't have a problem with it, some gamers might. Hopefully, it will be changed with a patch in the near future.

-Lastly, although there is a quick-start guide included in the box, it could have been better. It leaves out things such as: How to connect this headset to the PS4, to a phone (to take calls), to a 'digital music player' (like the iPod), what buttons do (aside from their technical names)...Although it's nice that the full manual is available on the Turtle Beach website, we would have appreciated not being forced to access the internet.

Game worked for me perfectly on release night. I am not sure if there were server issues before that, but I experienced none of them. I have played the first two worlds so far and I enjoy it. It's a lot of the same Trials action as before.

Good:
-Trials is addictive fun with customization offered allowing infinite possibilities on future map developments.
-Levels range from easy to hard as with the past games.
-Arcade game feel still remains intact.
-Game case actually includes an instruction manual (this is the first I've had in all of my Xbox One games!)

Bad:
-Camera angles follow more closely to Trials 2 than the original. I like the more static view as sometimes the following and turning camera can make it difficult to gauge an obstacle properly.
-Early levels are more about long jumps and timing smooth landings instead of intricate jumps. I expect it to get harder, but one of the things that Trials left after the first one is the idea of a small level. I like the mix between super long jumps and smaller levels that make me feel like I'm in a warehouse or something.

Overall, the game is good. The $40 release is worth it to me as this would have been an easy $20 for me to spend on the digital copy, but also includes a season pass to DLC.

Installation - did require online connection to register/activate.  It only took a few minutes - not a big ordeal like STEAM for instance.

Graphics - first impression was bad but after a short time I got used to them and ended up being impressed.  Armor, weapons, etc. were very detailed.  You could actually see the hob nails on the bottom of your boot soles when running.  Weather effects (rain, lightning, snow, sand storms, mist, fog) were excellent.

Voice acting - again, first impression was bad to o.k.  The mixing in of archaic words (mayhap, nay, prithee, forsooth) seemed silly.  After awhile I got used to it and would grade voice acting at least a C.  Your character (whose dialog is fully voiced) is actually very good.  His goofy laugh and sarcastic comments are funny.

Character creation - a major negative for me.  You can only play one character (human male).  A bit of customization is possible regarding height, hair and some facial features.

Combat - o.k.  You don't use RMB to block.  That is actually a passive skill.  There are multiple quick bars.  You are given unlimited arrows if using a bow.  There is a wide variety of traps and bombs.  The traps are too powerful though.  The smallest one can hold even a dragon immobile!  Why couldn't it just drag the trap along?

Horses - I agree with other reviewers that horses can be difficult to control.  They do have 3 distinct gaits but the movements are not smooth (see Mount and Blade).  If you are on flat terrain they are a lot easier to control.  You can attack from horseback and they do have saddlebags to carry more loot.

World - there is a huge, open world to explore.  A few quest related locations are locked at first but for the most part you can go just about anywhere you want.  The terrain includes anything you can think of - sandy beaches, woods, plains, swamps, deserts, bamboo forests.  There is a huge variety of creatures, many exclusive to certain areas so as you explore the world you continually encounter new creatures.  They don't respawn but there are so many in such a big world that it would be hard to imagine running out of things to fight.  Adversaries are not leveled (great).  In the beginning some are impossibly difficult.  After much advancement many creatures can be killed with one hit.  The progression in skill makes you feel that all the effort was worth it.

Alchemy - there is an extensive system for making potions, traps, bombs, and weapon power ups.  You can experiment and save your own recipes.  They should have had a separate screen for alchemy items though.

Weapons and armor - a huge variety.  Two items of the same type can be combined into one with greater values.  There are 3 types of physical damage and weapons do more of less damage depending on the armor type of the defender.  Power ups can be added to weapons to do additional magic damage (fire, cold, poison, etc.)  One mission allowed you to wear a disguise to infiltrate the enemy camp - fun.

Locked chests - actually have useful or valuable contents.  (not like some games where you open a locked chest and find an apple or dried fish!)

Factions - there are several guilds and factions.  You don't actually join them but their attitude toward you changes depending on your actions.

Quests - large in number and variety

Inventory/Economics/Loot/Inventory - way too much stuff.  There is a weight limit but it is so high that you can literally carry over a dozen weapons and several suits of armor - not at all realistic.  Even if you were Hercules and could lift a ton how could you hold and carry multiple shields, swords, spears, pole arms, bows, helmets, armor, etc.?  If you find a better weapon or armor switch them with what you have.  Loot should mainly consist of money, gems, and jewelry.

Trainers - good.  You have to find and pay a trainer to learn a new skill.  After that, you can use available points you have earned to increase the skill.

Enemy AI - as good as other games.  I loved it that creatures would sometimes fight each other.  I remember one quest early on where I was supposed to kill an ogre.  Each hit on it did about as much damage as a pin prick but one hit from it would kill me.  As I circled around on my horse I attracted a large group of bandits.  They chased me but I led them toward the ogre and they eventually started fighting it.  I then lured in a group of wyverns that also fought the ogre.  I just sat back and watched.  Eventuall the ogre was killed, I got credit for it, and I collected a bunch of loot from the dead bandits.  That was a lot of fun.

Classes - you could basically do anything (a negative for me).  I think it is more fun to play one of the four basic types of character (fighter, mage, ranger, thief).
The game actually had some plate armor that, when worn, prohibited you from using a bow.  That type of restriction was what should have been used for all weapons and armor to guide players into playing as one class of character.

For example, you shouldn't be able to ""sneak"" while wearing plate armor or carrying a shield or pole arm.  So a thief character would not use them.  For a mage, just say that the wearing of metal prevents a spell caster from focusing mana.  That way if you wanted to play a mage you would wear the appropriate robe and carry a staff for a back up weapon.  If you wanted other classes to be able to use ""heal"" spells just change the rule slightly and say metal disrupts the ""projection"" of mana energy.  Then any class could use ""heal"" or ""bless"" spells but not offensive magic.  (if wearing chain or plate armor or carrying a sword for instance)

The first character I played was basically a fighter but also used magic, sneaked, and used a bow.  It just wasn't as much fun as playing a defined class.  I voluntarily restricted myself to the above rules and started new games as a mage, thief, and ranger.  I settled on the ranger and played the game to the end (I think) using that character.

I got to what I thought would be the big showdown but just brought up a cut scene with me being told I had been tricked.  That led me to a new quest which was pretty quick because I had previously cleared out the areas involved.  When I finally got to the big showdown I just shot and killed him with several arrows.  Then the game just ended - went back to the menu.  Going back to the last save I tried again, this time first approaching and talking to the big boss.  At one point there were 2 dialog choices.  I picked one, fought and defeated him, and the same thing happened.
I tried again, picking the other option.  That caused 5 unknown characters to appear in place of the big boss.  I was able to defeat them.  Again, the game just went to the menu.  ???  I never saw my sister again no matter what I did.  Did the game allow me to finish without completing some critical step?  Or was that really the end?  Either way it was really bad.

Overall -  Two Worlds is a fine action/rpg.  With a few changes it would be great.
The biggest drawback for me was the lack of character customization.  Change the story slightly and say the kidnapped woman is your half-sister.  Then you could be half elf, half dwarf, etc.  Add a female character option.  If I had to choose between hearing/seeing my character talk and having more character options, I would take the latter.  Creating your own customized character is a large part of the fun of a rpg.  It is what really ""connects"" you to them.  Do that, add some diversions (gambling or skill games, fishing [Fable], wenching [Witcher], restrict inventory, and clean up the ending (add a cut scene to show what happens) and you would have a classic game on a par with any other.","Two Worlds - RPG, Single Player, Open World, rel. 2007",1334880000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Epic', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

This game is vast in scope. It runs very well on my mid level machine.  If you are a gamer- then you realize that your computer needs a good video card and 2 gigs of ram these days. If you are buying new products with on board video and 512 ram then your not going to get anywhere.

I find this game alot more interesting than Rome TW was. there are quite a few extra things to do for wealth and subterfuge. Of course the real time battles are still awesome to take charge of.

I believe a TRUE turn based strategy gamer will have no problem with this title- It's all about taking your time and keeping track of the Worlds politics- and crushing those who get in your way.

As I stated at the beginning - most of the complaints Ive read are not warranted- Ive seem people complain about getting attacked (out of the blue) from other factions- there are reasons for this-it isn't random- If they kept an eye on the Alliances and how the Papal states felt about their faction- then they would understand why things occur.

It's got a campaign that you can play in splitscreen co-op, custom arcade (skirmish) where you can play with bots and customize the match almost in any way, and even a map editor! Granted the mapmaker only allows you to make small indoor maps with a limited number of themes, but that's always better than no map editor at all.

I would have given this a 5/5, but there were certain annoyances I can't get over. In order to unlock features (such as maps) in the Custom Arcade, you must beat certain things such as Challenges, the Arcade League, and the Campaign on all difficulties. Most maps  are locked behind this limit, so that's a downer when those maps are interesting or fun.

I had been looking forward to this game since it was announced (at E3 I believe).  I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Wright series, so I thought this game was right up my alley.  However one thing concerned me... it was made by the same folks who did Trace Memory.

I didn't like Trace Memory.  I thought the story was uninteresting (and I was disappointed and annoyed by the ending) and the whole presentation was very blandly executed.  Tap on a bookshelf and maybe there will be an item that you need and so on.  The only redeeming quality was some clever DS-feature puzzles.

Hotel Dusk is very similar to Trace Memory, but improved in most ways.  The story, although it starts out at an absolute crawl, is terrific.  It's kind of like the show Lost.  Every guest in the hotel has their own story that you go through (or pry outta them) and each story contributes to a greater underlying story.  And just about all the stories are interesting.  The mysteries will keep you tapping through.  And there will be one or more occasions where the stories are even heartwarming.  It's amazing how well you get to know these characters.

Your character starts out as a complete jerk (and in a way stays that way), but in order to advance through the game and not get kicked out of the hotel, you have to make him more likable by choosing what he says.  Though it may seem at first that this game is tailored for young adult boys (it's got some mild profanity), I can see it being just as enjoyed by young girl casual gamers.

The puzzles in this game are not hard at all.  Some may throw you off for a bit, but a small amount of thinking and notetaking solves everything.  There are a few clever uses for the DS, but nothing really mindblowing. I'm glad that the puzzles are doable, but I kinda wish they were a little more challenging and rewarding.  There are many moments where you have to choose the correct thing to say (between 2 possible responses) in a row, otherwise the game is over.  This is pretty frustrating and the game overs happen often, so make sure to save a lot so you don't have to go through a lot of text dialogue again.

I'm not a big fan of the quiz at the end of each chapter.  Trace Memory did the same and I find it really annoying that they need to reiterate the story.

But if you can stick through the first two chapters, you'll find a beautifully crafted game with excellent characters, stories and storytelling.  It's been a real pleasure walking in the shoes of the main character, Kyle Hyde.  And I'll be sad when it ends.

But I just went back to Street Fighter (Super Street Fighter 4 specifically) after not playing Street Fighter for over 7 years and I have to say the dualshock 3 is great for some things but sucks for others. I ordered the Hori PS3 Fighting Stick because I just simply couldn't get my Ultra Combos off consistently with a DS3. I spent nearly 5 hours with the Hori last night (10-21_10) and while it made ultra combos easier, there were basic functions that I just couldn't seem to do. I use Fei Long as my main character and the three hit Rekka Combo was almost impossible to do consistently. Dashing was harder than it should have been but ironically enough,Fei Long's Sheinkyakyu (flaming kick) combos worked like a charm. I think this may be because of the 4 way gate instead of the octagonal 8 way gate that's in the Hori. I can't be sure yet because it could also be because I haven't used a arcade stick in a long time.

One thing I am sure of it the actual directional stick is too short. My hands get cramped trying to use it for long periods because I'm constant brushing against the base of the Hori during movement. The button layout is do-able but weird especially considering the original Street Fighter layout I remember was a even three over three button layout. I understand Hori (and nearly ever other Stick maker) uses a more ergonomically friendly layout but it still takes some getting used to. The quality of the buttons is ok. Not as robust as some fighting sticks I've seen but it gets the job done. It will be interesting to see how they hold up over time. I'll update the review if needed.

Overall build quality is not bad. It has rubber feet so the control stays in place when on a flat surface. It has just enough weight to not feel totally cheap and the actual stick makes the clicking sound of some of the older arcade units I remember. It's not a bad deal for less than $50 bucks and Amazon Prime 1 day shipping. I'll stick with it for another solid week or so to be sure my issues just aren't me having growing pains of going back to a stick. But for beginners looking to use their first fighting stick, it's not better than some other sticks I've seen.

I truly think this game succeeds, even though it could have been much better. Sadly the worst part of this game is the story, which is disappointing for an RPG. The game excels during all of the addictive side missions, but any time they try to inject the story it greatly detracts from the experience. I played as a warrior, generally staying away from the bow and sorcery, as I thought neither of them worked too well. For the warrior, it's nice that each different type of weapon has a different attack series, but I wish there were more modifiers, and more ways to evolve improve those special attacks. I actually really like their weapon upgrading system, but it just needed a few tweaks. Every weapon or piece of armor is made up of a combination of steel, iron, chainmail, wood, cloth, and leather. You can upgrade everything with a certain amount of these raw materials very highly as long as you have upgraded you stats. The best part of this is that every weapon you get from a downed enemy can be dismantled to its raw parts. This means that even when you fight weak enemies way below your level you are greatly rewarded with the same amount of parts received from high level items. However, this also creates the biggest problem, where you've upgraded your favorite weapon to it's max, but when you get a new better weapon, your former favorite is now useless. All you can do is dismantle it for the same minimal amount as the lowest level of equipment, or you can sell it for a couple hundred gold, which is also useless.

Like I said earlier, while the game itself is really fun and addictive, the story is horrendous (you're about to enter spoiler town). I can tell you the story in a few sentences: The story apparently starts right where the last left of (which is very annoying since I and probably everyone else couldn't play through the last horrible game) and your lifeforce is drained into your sister so the evil emperor can raise some evil god/demon. After being taken back to the dungeon a group of Orcs liberate you and then send you on a mission to essentially level up and learn how to kill the emperor. This is really the last of the story until later on where you start to learn about the annoying backstory of the emperor in an attempt to humanize him. Then once you finally get to confront the emperor it turns out he's a good guy trying to prevent the evil god form returning, while the woman you've been working for the whole game is actually the enemy. She then appears and turns into a dragon for your final battle. This is even worse because the only way to kill the dragon is to use these crossbows set up in a circle, a completely different mechanic that kind of works, and completely eliminates any benefits from leveling up the entire game.

Still I enjoyed the game, there's a lot of fun to had, it's a long game. I have high hopes for a third Two Worlds, as long as the developer again makes the game better.",A Good B Game,1313107200,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Anyway, after reading all the hype surrounding ME3 I decided to give ME1 & 2 a try. You can see a lot of similarities in the two games (only 1-2 years apart) and definitely see where DAO gameplay evolved from ME1.

First the technical stuff:
The game downloaded with no problem. I even had my computer go to sleep in the middle of the download and had to stop it and restart it a day later and still, all the bits came through without a problem.

The game did not work on my Win 7 machine at first, it would crash at the configuration utility when trying to start up. I had to go to the website and find the patch, after that it ran flawlessly. That said, I don't understand why a 4+ year old game doesn't immediately go out an look for the latest patch(es) after installing. Or at least provide you a button to do so, much less include it in the game itself so you don't have to waste time searching on your own. Clearly the EA/Bioware/whomever just threw the necessary files over the wall to Amazon's servers sans modification/updating.

Next, try as I might, I couldn't find a manual for the game. Maybe I'm too old school but the in-game tutorial wasn't exactly a beacon of information so I wanted to read the manual - no such animal was included in the download or Bioware's support website. So again, I had to search the web for a manual and download it myself.

Granted, all this wasn't a huge deal and only took a little while to overcome and is how it used to be by default, and yes, the game is well-priced, but still...when I drive a car off the lot, used or not, I don't expect it have to put oil in it and fill up the tires. Also, why in the world the developers decided to make that g-awful video haze by default, I can't imagine but I turned that off immediately.

Game/Gameplay:
If DAO could be called a fighting game with some talking, ME1 is a talking game with some fighting. There seems to be an endless amount of dialogue options available and one could spend days exploring all of them. And 8 hours into it, I HATE ELEVATORS. I dread getting on any elevator because of the length of time it takes to get from one level to another on some worlds. Apparently, the far future hasn't figured out how to make express elevators. Gameplay is a little confusing too - I haven't completely figured out how to do certain things or what certain things are for (Hey, maybe I could read the manual!). Also, some of the dialogue options you're presented with don't match what comes out of Shepard's mouth but that's a quibble. I also didn't like the fact that you have to hold down the space bar to do the tactical stuff during battles.

The game is fun, despite the prolonged dialogue that kills the momentum every now and then. One feature I really liked over DAO was the fact that Shepard actually spoke which I thought was a big improvement over the DAO's monoexpressioned nonspeaking main character. I really felt like I was guiding the story to some degree. Like DAO, ME1 appears to be a huge game with a good plot, great voicing, and visually excellent. It's a good game with an engrossing storyline and definitely worth picking up at its current pricing.",Good but not DAO Good,1330992000,2,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

Here you'll find some bizarre things and even more bizarre people. Shivering Isles is the expansion pack to the brilliant Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

Key Features:
Two New Armor and Weapons Sets
Many new special weapons and magical items
About 20-25 hours of new gameplay
A good amount of new enemies
New conjuration spells
New greater power spells

Gameplay 7 of 10
As odd as it sounds, the gameplay is not as good as Oblivion even though they are based on the same combat system and the quests are very similar. First off, even though the map is about one-fifth the size of Cyrodiil, it seems smaller. There are only 30-40 places to go. Quests are either found by talking to Sheogorath or seeking out random quests within the realm. There are caves, ruins, homesteads and New Sheoth-the capital and only city in The Shivering Isles. New Sheoth houses both Crucible and Bliss which represent the opposite sides of the Isles - mania and dementia. Side quests are sort of uninspiring. One quest entailed finding calipers and tongs to sell to some idiotic guy who was collecting them.

Creatures 7 of 10
Creatures found in the Shivering Isles reflect the essence of it. They are somewhat more magical or otherworldly. Where as you'll find bears, wolves and mountain lions quite commonly in Cyrodiil, here you'll see tree creatures, giant ant-like monsters called Elytra and Scalons which resemble lizards that walk on two feet. Almost everything here is stronger and more ferocious. My only problem with the creatures is I believe I can name off all of them without even playing the game. So in terms of variety, it can get old. You'll be fighting Grummites most of the time.

Story 9 of 10
Mania and dementia are the basis of the Shivering Isles; two sides of the same coin. When you first enter the ""strange door"" you meet Haskill which is Sheogorath's personal assistant. Haskill makes sure you want to enter the Shivering Isles. He has a rather interesting stoicism and indifference to his tone. After this you enter the Fringe.
To get past the Fringe you must defeat the Gatekeeper- a 12 foot tall creature with a weapon attached to its right arm. Once you've done this you can choose whether to enter mania-a land which vaguely resembles the inside of Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory or dementia-a downtrodden less colorful version of The Shivering Isles. Note that either side both have the same locations.

After this you are sent to see the madman himself - Sheogorath. He asks you to do various quests and what not. It is sort of like being in a guild, but after each quest you end up with a much better reward than you normally would. The story is has a lot more of a plotline to it than the original game.

Armors / Weapons 8 of 10
There are two new armor sets: Amber and Madness for mania and dementia respectively. In the realm of Sheogorath, you must find the constituents of the armor to create it as opposed to just buying pre-armor. Amber requires pieces of amber to create both the armor and weapons, just as the madness armor does. The amber is a light armor, while madness is heavy armor. If you happen to find a matrix, this can be used to create a whole piece of the armor. There are also very impressive pieces of armor later on in the main quest line, which are much more powerful than anything found in Cyrodiil. Weapons here are all marginally stronger to begin with than regular weapons. One in particular dubbed Duskfang is very strong and has multiple enchantments.

Graphics 6 of 10
At first look the visuals are every bit as appealing and detailed as Oblivion. When you get a little closer, you see it isn't the case. Unfortunately only a few of the weapons and the Amber armor are really remarkable. Amber armor looks like a yellowish-orange glass armor set. New enemy combatants in general appear lackluster-especially the Elytras. It is almost like they left off the last level of 3-d rendering. The landscape of mania is very lit up, vibrant and rainbow colored. It is the only redeeming quality to the graphics. All said, the landscape has very little detail and parts of the trees are not even solid-you can walk right through them. Basically, instead of improving upon the graphics in the Isles, the developers actually took them a step or two down. Parts of it really remind me of Elder Scrolls III

What I would have added:
First off, you should have been able to purchase a house; though you can inherit one on one of the side quests. Secondly, there should have been a place to enchant weapons and create spells. It got really annoying having to fast travel from the Shivering Isles to the gate, out of the gate and then to the Arcane university. More monsters should have been added and more time should have been spent on the texturing and details of the landscape and creatures.

Overall the expansion is a solid 7 out of 10, but has little replay value for me. I was a little disappointed in the general gameplay and also the amount of playing time. I paid about $28 for probably 20 hours of game time, when I got an average of 120 hours for each one of my Oblivion characters. So the value factor is kind of low. Visually, the game has very few things that will wow you. So I wouldn't recommend this to just anyone. You'd have to be a pretty big fan of these types of RPGs or Elder Scrolls in the first place.","So Different, Yet So Much Alike",1215648000,11,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Needless to say the xbox was the personification of gaming potential, with a graphics engine that far surpassed any of the competition, it seemed emminent that the xbox was the next best thing in gaming, however, it was not to be.  With a line up of lack luster games and a backing company that seemed to care much more about the mighty buck than the consumer, the x box was a system that could not meet its potential.  Now, however, is a new era, and gaming is not the same as it once was, and with the coming of the new age microsoft has decided to pull out the big guns.  The xbox 360 is an improvement on the old in every aspect of gamining, a more powerful graphics engine and a line up of excellent games make this machine ideal for anyones gaming needs,  i am not going to compare this system to the PS3 or to the WII because all three systems have their strengths and weaknesses, the ps3 has great graphics potential but so far the game line up has been terrible, the WII has inovativeness and is extremely fun but has lack luster graphics, and the xbox 360 is kind of the middle ground where it is not as powerful as the ps3 and not as fun as the wii but still manages to deliver a solid package.

GRAPHICS

As i said before, the visuals on this system are top notch,  when playing games like ghost recon or F.E.A.R. you truly get to appreciate the blood and brains that go splattering towards your screen when you hit with a well placed head shot, and with games like oblivion one gets to appreciate the ambient feeling of everlastin bliss that can only be obtained from visualising the most beautiful of environments.

FUN FACTOR

So far there isn't a very large library of memorable games for the 360, so far the only 3 i really like are ghost reacon, fear, and oblivion, but i loved all three of those games and i dropped about 200+ hours of my life into oblivion so i cannot complain in that department, what really makes this system fun, however, is its online playability.  I'll tell you right now there is nothing quite so fun as calling up a bunch of your friends and killing eachother on an open internet network, throw that in with movie, game, and music downloads, and you have got yourself hours of fun.

HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS

Here is where i feel the 360 really shines.  From extra battery chargers to alternate the battery on your controller so that your game is never interrupted, to an add-on hd dvd player, the xbox 360 has more neat gadgets than any other system on the market.  If you are thinking of purchasing a 360 however i will have to recommend that you purchase the system cooler, because this system gets hot!!!  Before i got the cooler, oblivion constantly glitched up, and it kept freezing on me, bur after i got the cooler running all my games run smooth as a baby's bottom, (not to say the cooler does look pretty cool).  On another note, if you have a high defenition tv and are looking for an inexpensive hd dvd player then look no farther, the 360 add on is a 200 dollar high defenition dvd player which looks great, and best of all, is completely optional, if you have an hd tv then get it, if you don't then don't. Finally i have to say something about the 360's wireless controller, it is one of the best peripherals for any system since the wave bird, it is the lazy man's greatest invention, now with the touch of a button on your controller you can start your system with out having to get your lazy a$# off of the couch.

PRICE

In the end if you get the xbox 360 and the hd dvd add on you would be paying just as much as if you bought a ps3 with the blue ray already installed, the difference, with the xbox you get the option of getting the add on if you want it or not.

In conclusion the xbox 360 is a great system with a lot going for it, i think it can hold its own pretty well against the competition (even if the wii is sold out everywhere, damn i want one), and it was the first next gen councel i purchased, so it will always have a place in my heart.

4.0,False,"12 27, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000GQ1NK4,Tsanche,"The Metal Slug games are arcade classics. Giving classic shooters such as Contra a run for their money, Metal Slug truly made shooters a completely different experience. These arcade classics are now available in an anthology package. The games include Metal Slug 1-5, Metal Slug X and the never before officially released Metal Slug 6.

When you begin the game you have all the Metal Slug games from the get go. So you don't have to unlock any of the games, they're all right there from the get go. It's fun to play these games for two reasons. One, it's nice to see just how each game changes from one to the next. The series really evolves as time goes on. Also, they're really tough games that even the most experienced of gamers will have trouble with.

Each game has a unique art style going for it. Each level in every game is literally littered with thousands of enemies and troops. You'll be able to get a hold of weapons like a flamethrower or shotgun to thwart your enemies. You'll also be able to throw grenades. The challenge in these games don't let up, though. It's a good thing that you can give yourself infinite continues. You'll certainly need them. The look and feel of these games hasn't really changed much. It's all still there. The blood, the explosions, the tough bosses. They're perfect emulations.

Part of the excitement with the Metal Slug Anthology, specifically for the Wii, is the immense number of control set ups you can have. There's the standard classic set up which involves you holding your wii remote horizontally (as if you were playing Excitetruck or a Classic NES title from the virtual console) and mowing through your enemies in a classic fashion. You'll flick the remote to use grenades. Another style involves you using the wii remote as a joystick. Another is the basic nunchuck for movement/wii remote to activate actions. There's even a control mode for you to use just the nunchuck. Another control mode involves you tilting your remote to do certain actions. Finally, the Gamecube controller itself can be used to play these games.

All these control set ups seem fantastic, but only two of them are really all that comforting. The wii remote being used like an NES controller and the Gamecube controller setup. Other than that, most of these controls mode are a pain. Also, it's a shame that the classic controller isn't one of the controller setups at all. Metal Slug Anthology is a classic game, yet it doesn't utilize the classic controller at all.

The extras are even more mundane. As you complete games you'll unlock some neat artwork for the art gallery, and some interviews but that's about it. Nothing really outside of that. The interviews aren't spectacular at all. No audio or video to speak of. Just text on your screen for you to read. While the art is nice, it seemed that far more extras could've been included.

To give credit to the Metal Slug Anthology, however, you are getting seven games for a relatively cheap price. To make it even more worthwhile all seven games are actually good, unlike some anthologies where there's usually one black sheep. In the Metal Slug Anthology there is no ""blacksheep"" in the flock, they're all marvelous games. It's just sad that there weren't enough extras to be included here, and that the majority of the six control schemes are just worthless.

They're fantastic games, but they could've done more with the package.

Like Paper Mario(N64) and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga(Gameboy Advance) before it, Partners is an engrossing RPG that is not only addictive to play but humorous as well. Mario and Luigi travel back in time to rescue Princess Peach, only to come face to face with baby versions of themselves, the princess and Bowser. Teaming up with their baby versions send Mario and Luigi on an adventure of their life as players must control both the adult AND baby versions of the Mushroom Kingdom heroes. The result is absolutely hilarious, at times. Apart from the second screen and character aspect, Partners in Time doesn't stray too far from the Superstar Saga original. It has more elaborate puzzles, and more action-based fights than the original game, though, and it's alot meatier in terms of gameplay time. Although it doesn't explore the Nintendo DS like other developers have, Partners in Time definitely approaches the system in more extremely creative ways. You'll see what I'm talking about when you play the game. It's defiitely a game that diehard and casual RPG fans should pick up.

My biggest gripe, however, with Partners in Time is the graphics. Alphadream coulda, at the very least, spiced things up a little bit in that department instead of giving us GBA visuals, which is something I've noticed lately on games coming out for the DS. Why are developers giving us GBA graphics when the Nintendo DS is capable of so much more? With games like Castlevania, I could understand the reason why but, even then, Konami made certain aspects of their latest Castlevania adventure more 3-D'ish.

Once again, though, Alphadream delivers an outstanding RPG worthy of your time. Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time is a blast.",Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time....,1133395200,16,,

4.0,True,"04 2, 2009",A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B001AW156U,J.S. Knapp,"One of the main reasons I quit playing Playstation 3 was because I'd literally develop hand-cramps while playing.  The lower triggers on the controller tilted upwards into the unit, whereas your fingers wanted to pull in or almost downwards on them.  This required you to either catch the top edge of the triggers, giving you a very narrow contact point, or change the way you held the controller which resulted in great discomfort.

These ""snap-on"" additions to the controller bring the contact point out much further, and allows you to pull downwards on the trigger in a much more natural motion.  It's a vast improvement on comfort and gameplay.  It's just not 100% perfect.

Since these triggers snap over the existing triggers, you end up with something taller and wider than the original piece.  The ""wider"" seems to be the biggest issue, as the new trigger now sits wider than the pad between your finger joints.  It becomes a new spot of discomfort, though not pain-inducing.  The bottom of the trigger also angles out a bit more than it should, so your finger can't sit flat against it and basically ""slides"" back towards the top of the trigger... ...where it's too wide.  In the end, your fingers still constantly shift around, trying to find that perfect comfort spot.

Being somewhat mechanically and electrically inclined, I'd have preferred a trigger REPLACEMENT, which would require opening the controller and swapping components.  Obviously that would create liability issues out the ying-yang, and wouldn't appeal to the general masses.

But these certainly improve gaming comfort while adding a few discomforts of their own.  I still wonder how the original design of the Six-Axis/DualShock 3 controllers was EVER approved for production.","A NEEDED change, just not 100% there, yet.",1238630400,3,,

Take this on your next plane trip to pass the time. The mini games are what round this out. The monkey golf one is really cool. And Monkey Fight is so frantic and fun you'll laugh your @$$ off just because you're having so much fun (sort of like how Mario Kart did for me all those years back). So far I've played this game more than I have any other GBA game that I own.

Basically it's marble madness in 3D. Instead of a trackball or analog stick you have the D-pad. Not the best control for something like this, but the game is playable and that's all I ask when it comes to gameplay. Rather than you moving the ball around you tilt the floor to get the monkey-in-a-ball to move. This can be disorienting to those expecting to have a stable floor to move around on but a tiltable floor lends challenge to the gameplay in my opinion. The camera can get frustrating, but the stages are simple enough so that you can anticipate/memorize what's behind the camera. No action buttons used except in the menu screens and mini games. And even then it's not too complicated.

Those looking for a challenging game that you can get into right away and that doesn't require a couple hours reading a strategy guide will find this game very enjoyable. This is arcade puzzle action. Not a RTS or a MMORPG.

First off lets get the comparisons to Dead Island and Mirrors Edge out of the way. The game feels and plays very much like the Dead Island franchise, as the combat feels like it was ripped straight from Dead Island, however this time your attacks feel like they have weight, and slicing zombies apart is oh so satisfying. Parkour is what sets itself apart from the other zombie hack em ups though, and it feels solid and controls nice once you get the feel for it.

It feels a bit clunky at first, but once you get it down and learn the tips and tricks, its a necessity for survival, since you cant fight the hordes head on, and when I say hordes, I mean hordes. Even when you have some of the highly powerful weapons, its easy to find yourself surrounded, especially when you first start and you have crappy weapons, in these cases fighting is out of the question. Its really fun, and I often times find myself running off course of my way point, to keep my parkour streak up.

As you run, fight, and survive you level up in all these areas, which in turn unlock extremely useful abilities, like leaping over zombies when your surrounded, or an attack where you can brake their legs rendering them harmless. Parkour is a wonderful addition to a game which would otherwise feel like every other zombie game ever.

Weapon modding is just like dead island, so if you played those games you will feel right at home. Basically what crafting boils down to is finding blue prints and finding parts and pressing x to craft, its easy and fast. Side missions will consume most of your time in the city of Harren, and you will be surprised to see how fast they pile up. Essentially side missions play like fetch quests, go here, grab that, get out. But there is some diversity to keep it from being repetitive. And unlike other games, this one gives you reasonable reasons as to why your doing this quests, from saving a women from a man keeping her trapped in his basement, to finding a book in an infested cafe on how to garden. And often times, your actions directly effect the world, even as they are simple, like seeing a garden on the roof growing crops and veggies.

However there are some problems. The first being the bad story, it tries to be serious and dark, but ultimately is cliche and full of plot holes and uninteresting, and same looking characters. This is unfortunate as it had to opportunity to make a stand out story. Though the graphics look stunning at times, with wonderfully lit areas and amazing views, there are some noticeably  blurry textures. Its not a huge issue since you'll be rushing past them with a horde of zombies on your tail, but when you slow down and look, they are there.

The last thing I want to talk about in this game is when it turns to night. At night even the most harmless zombie becomes a killing machine, and you better high tale it to a safe point. There is intense tension during night segments, especially when you use a move to look behind you and see a group of very powerful zombies right behind you about to attack. The night was surprisingly scary, and made me dread the alarm clock beeping alerting me its night time.

I had preordered this, and after reading some bad reviews, I was uncertain when I went  to pick it up in the store.  I've played several different Alien games over the years, and ALL of them have been miserable failures.  I was sooooooooo psyched when I first heard about this game, and preordered it waaaay back.  I had the option to cancel my preorder, but chose to bite the bullet and take a chance.  Boy am I glad that I did.  I've read many reviews giving the graphics very low ratings.  I would like to defend the graphics in this game.  Are they mind blowingly realistic??????  No.  Do they help me lose myself in the game???  YES.  The atmospheres are really reminiscent of the Aliens movie.  There are points in the game where the xenomorphs come out of the walls, which is a frightening point of the game.  That mirrors one of the scenes from the film where the Aliens literally come out of the walls behind the characters.  It was truly unexpected the first time it happened, and it made me smile just a little.  The one area I would have to say I was disappointed in the game was that there were actually graphic freezes during most of the cut scenes.  That is NOT when you want any kind of freezing to occur.  I never experienced this during actual gameplay, but it became routine in cut scenes.  A little annoying, but not mind altering enough to make me hate the game.  The graphics are not top notch, but they are not the crap that so many have claimed them to be.  One of the things I really liked about this game was when you were picking up ammo from the scene, if one of the weapons in your arsenal is full, it does not show up on the landscape to pick up. That's one thing that is annoying to me is other games when i see ammo, run over to it, only to find out that my inventory is already full of that particular ammo.  This may seem like a minor thing to some, but it was something that really stood out to me.  It was also very easy to change weapons on the fly in this game.

Now, let me tell you where this game really shines!!!!!  Whoever is responsible for the sound design of this game, deserves an award.  If you are a fan of the film, you will truly appreciate the sound effects in this game.  The weapons sound just like the ones in the movie, and the eery blip of the motion tracker is unnerving in scenes where you just know there is one just waiting to jump out at you.  The music is also just spot on with the soundtrack from the original film.  The screams of the xenomorphs send chills down my spine.  When you get close to the end, you keep hearing the sounds of the queen Alien, but you keep waiting to see her.  This really helped to create some tension in the game.  I have to say that the sound of this game helped in more ways that any game I've played to help set the mood and put you in the world of the game.  Hats off to the people who designed the sound for this game!!!

While the campaign is actually pretty short (it took me about 7 hours on soldier mode), the multiplayer adds a lot or replay ability to it.  I'm hoping that some upgrades will take care of some of the problems with this game, but I still have to give this game a thumbs-up.

4.0,False,"06 7, 2005",A3I92PEEL1B62O,B0007QCNR0,wysewomon,"Victoria MacPherson is a young FBI agent with a reputation for ignoring procedure.  She's investigating a series of brutal murders in Chicago when, home for the holidays, she has a peek into her Grandfather Gus's trunk.  Grandpa was a PI in the 20's and it seems that one of his last cases bears an eerie similarity to the one Victoria is investigating now.  Can Gus's old case files help Vic figure out what's going on?

I really, really liked Still Life, but there are some things you should know going into it.  First off, it's not really a whodunnit, solve the crime and catch the killer kind of story.  It has a mystery theme, but it's more about how a series of crimes has reached through time to haunt the family MacPherson than it is about Law and Order.  And that is really, really well done.  The parallels between the Gus case and the Victoria case are not so obvious as to be ludicrous but still meaningful.  And the story is both moving and frightening, with lots of ""Oh No!"" moments.

Second of all, Still Life is a little atypical in its set-up.  There are certain adventure game conventions that are just ignored and whether you find this annoying or kind of a relief will depend on you.  The conversation trees are a case in point.  Many games go out of the way to give the impression that conversing with other characters is interactive by allowing you to choose from a long list of discussion topics, even knowing that most gamers will exhaust every single topic before exiting the conversation.  In Still Life, the pretense that you have some choice in this matter is dispensed with.  You just keep clicking until you're done.  You're not given any choice of topic or any way of choosing what order the conversation happens in.  I thought this was fine.  Some people really didn't like it.

Still LIfe is fairly linear.  There are aspects of it that are more like an interactive movie than a gamey-game.  Many of the tasks you'll accomplish don't really have much of an affect on the outcome;  they merely allow you to proceed to the next part of the story.  There was only one place where I had no idea what to do next;  most of the time your character stated her (or his;  you play as both Gus and Victoria) intention up front.  The in-game menus offers both a conversation log and character journals for more information, as well.  Puzzles are inventory-based mechanical and your inventory offered a ""view"" option for each item, wherein you could manipulate it in 3-D to collect more clues (I like this kind of thing a lot).  There were only 3 puzzles of particular frustration.  One where you had to randomly guess which ingredients in a recipe were which would have been greatly improved by SOME kind of clue or identifiable system.  Another involved picking a lock that didn't actually seem to function in the way it was described.  The third, in which you must guide a robot through a room full of deadly lasers, actually was the easiest of the three for me in that I actually had a clue what to do and accomplished it with some practice.  I mention it here because many have considered it Still Life's low point.  Other than this latter (where timing is important), there are no timed puzzles and you can't die.

One frustrating thing is that you have to follow a pretty strict system for using the inventory.  When you encounter a hotspot, even if you have the item you need with you you can't really use it until you have clicked on the hotspot without it.  Sometimes you can't collect the item you need until you've clicked on the hotspot and been informed that you need it.  However, it was quite clear where everything was and easy to locate things in advance, so when you knew you needed them you could go right there instead of searching randomly.

Still Life is gorgeous to look at--the prerendered backgrounds are some of the best I've seen. Character movement was still a little stiff and stilted, however.  Many scenes are gruesome and gory;  we're talking serial murders here.  I thought the voice acting was pretty good.  Some people have complained about ethnic stereotypes.  I grew up in the inner city, so I didn't notice anything strange.  There is some salty language.

The ending is a cliffhanger.  Still Life was planned as the second in a trilogy of games (The first, Post Mortem is still available and worth playing, although you don't need to play it to understand and enjoy this one).  However, the third game may take a while to appear, if it ever does, because of Ubisoft's buy-out of Microids.  So if you want your game to be all wrapped up neatly at the end, you may be disappointed.

I played Still Life in about 20 hours and wished it was longer.  It reminded me a lot of both The Longest Journey and Syberia, though with a kind of X-Files twist.  This is surely one of the best new games I've played recently.",Pretty Darn Good,1118102400,83,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

4.0,True,"03 4, 2010",A21KN4ISHOTD51,B001QXNBNI,Matt,"This is my first Battlefield game so I write this review from a non-biased, not obsessed with the series review. I only point that out because you'll have a bunch of the ""I LOVE all Battlefield game"" type reviews and although it's cool to love the game, it doesn't give the rest of us a realistic picture of the game.

I will keep it simple...

Pros - The frost bite engine obviously; that is the platform used to create this game. You can literally blow up everything in the game. I love how you can just take apart a building if someone is hiding inside. You can also spawn with your team which is nice since the maps are so expansive. There also seems to be a fair number of maps available with enough depth to keep me interested. The single player campaign is decent, but lets face it, most FPS games are really all about the online action these days. And lastly, VEHICLES! Tanks, jet skis, 4-runners, helicopters, etc. AWESOME!!!!!! I would also say the graphics are pretty solid. I've also heard there are a lot of weapons options but since I am only a level 2 I have yet to really experience anything beyond my XMB assault rifle.

Cons - If you think you're going to get online with 7 or 8 friends and jump into a match against some guys, FORGET IT! Major failing in this game is the fact the online multi-player only has 4 person squads. I imagine this is because they want to keep with the 4-person squad behind the BF story. But who cares? Let me invite more than 3 other friends to play. AND, you will often have your group split up when attempting to join a game. That is terrible in my opinion and the primary reason I will most likely not spend a ton of time playing this otherwise good game. There is a way to have 24 person private matches, but sometimes you just wanna face a bunch of ""randoms"" with your friends, and more than 3 friends at that.","Mostly Good Gane, BAD Online Squad Size Options",1267660800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"09 25, 2015",AHLYPNMRTEG6E,B00ZJ20YQO,G. Ward,"To put this review in the proper light, I must begin by saying that, minus vacations, I have been playing Destiny nearly every day since it was first released. In spite of it's flaws, and there were/are many, I am a huge fan of this game. This game seems to be designed to stimulate the same receptors that are excited by gambling. You play and things drop like coins from a slot machine with all of the fanfare and sound effects of an Atlantic city casino. You experience this ""gambling high"" while you run around as a heavily armed and heavily armored Titan, Warlock or Hunter, shooting alien monsters in the face. Its like playing a slot machine in the middle of a space war.

This gambling mechanic, where the best loot in the game, drops randomly, rather than by skill or effort, is one of the major flaws of Destiny. It is the basis for many peoples love or hatred of this game and it is the main contributor to the grind involved in playing Destiny.

With the Taken King, Destiny has completely re-imagined the games economy to remove some the grind, reward play in PVE AND crucible, while continuing to offer random rewards. Things that were once just lucky drops, can now be earned more predictably with added features like Three of Coins and Vanguard Streak. The result is a greatly improved gaming experience that retains much of what made Destiny good while fixing many of the problems that probably launched thousands of controllers at TVs.

Notable Fixes and Additions:

1. Just playing the game gains you relevant drops and experience.
2. Blue and Green drops have new significance.
3. Quests add depth to the new story content.
4. Many worthwhile guns and armor pieces can be earned following a quest path.
5. The Dreadnaught area is large and more dangerous than previous areas.
6. Old strikes and stories have been reworked.
7. New crucible modes like Rift and Zone Control add to the PVP variety.
8. All weapons have been re-leveled with a cap going to 300 (possibly beyond).
9. A dismantled (sharded), year 2 exotic weapon can be repurchased at the tower.
10. Previously owned year 1 exotic armor and weapons can be purchased for Legendary marks.
11. The gunsmith has reputation AND quests.
12. Exotic and Legendary weapons can be infused to a higher level using legendary marks, glimmer and dismantling a weapon of higher power.
13. Ghosts now offer perks like increased intellect, material locating and increased glimmer from a specific enemy race, like the Hive.
14. Arm bands, sashes and cloaks also have perks like increasing the rate of scout rifle experience.
15. Two words: Nolan North. Much better than Dinklebot.
16. Two more words: Nathan Fillion. He adds some desperately needed humor to this series.

Some cons:

1. All of your year 1 gear will be nearly irrelevant upon completion of the story mission on your way to level 40. I say nearly, because the gunsmith asks you to shard rare and higher weapons during certain quests and year one weapons count.
2. The Gjallahorn rocket launcher you finally bought at the end of year one will be useful for about 2-3 hours of game play. See #1.
3. Iron banner sashes, arm bands and cloaks have lost nearly all value. I think they are level 30 vs. the cap of Level 300.
4. You still need to put in the hours to get the best gear.
5. The new story can be completed in about 4-5 hours, which is short for a new game. (Although the quests add a lot more gameplay meat.)
6. UPDATE: Without the availability of Etheric Light to upgrade year 2 weapons and armor, the Iron Banner has lost some of its purpose.
7. UPDATE: After 50+ matches in Iron Banner, I received 1 Iron Banner specific drop, the titan sash. This is counter to what Bungie described as the primary way of earning Iron Banner gear: Drops.
Gamers are passionate about this game. The low ratings of this game give some insight into that. Many of the people giving this game a low rating have played and been burnt out by the grind of the year one version of this game. These are experienced players that have put hundreds of hours into a game and come away disappointed. The expectations were so high for year 2 to fix every problem that backlash is probably inevitable.
8. UPDATE to #7: The latest patch has fixed the drop rate for the Iron Banner significantly. My drops for the week have been, 310, 311 and 313 Ghost Shell, 298, 299 and 300 Chest Piece, 308, 304 and 303 gauntlets, 318 greaves, 284 and 289 Machine Gun, and a 283 and 287 Hand Cannon.

The Taken King has not fixed every problem in Destiny. In addition, it has locked Year One players who don't buy the expansion out of some critical content. The game can still be a grind. In spite of all that, this is the best version of Destiny to date. It is an ambitious, deep and addictive game. The story telling has improved and the core gameplay continues to be enjoyable.

Many people have compared this ubisoft title to Pandemic's Full Spectrum Warrior as both require suppressing and flanking the enemy.  Although BIA is graphically and ambiently superior, FSW simply features better squad control.

The graphics of BIA is absolutely intricate. From the accurate recreations of actual sites to the foliage of trees bushes and shrubs, right down to the detail of the characters and weapons. Fun  aditions to the graphics lend to the reallistic feal of the game such as blurring effects from rain or streaks of blood speckling on your face from a gun shot wound. The most impressive  of these, the shock of a near miss from mortar shells.

The sound compliments the graphics perfectly. Bullets make distinctive sound depending on what types of surfaces they impact. A lot of production value was poured into the Foley department of the game and it shows having one of the best sound qualities of any game on the market. Voice acting is also superbly done. The men sound believable and shout back and forth during combat. I regret not speaking German as I can't understand what the enemy yells out-I'm sure its entertaining.

The playability of the game is the only aspect I had problems with. Although you have control of a suppresion and fire team, the squad AI is lacking. I'm sure most of the reviewers would disagree with me since everyone claims the AI is brilliant. While I do think it's very good, there are too many ocassions where my squad AI is lacking. Many times I've ordered one of the teams to take cover behind something safe, what happens is two of them will listen while the third runs in front of the cover and gets picked off by the germans. Another example is ordering my men to sprint across roads covered by MG's. They'll run across and get halfway to where I tell them to go and then decide to stop and stand in the middle of the road to shoot back at the MG, resulting in the entire team being mowed down, however sometimes they will obey and run across and hit the cover as I oredered-it seems random when they will listen and when they won't. The tactics of this game are very promissing but lack far behind Full Spectrum Warrior. Not once in that title did my squad disobey orders and engage the enemy with no cover from enemy fire. FSW also had good tactical features such as designating a field of fire to catch enemies by surprise. The poor squad AI is the only problem I've had with the game and in many times had to leave them in one area while I take out 20 enemies alone-IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE.

Overall I give the game a 8 out of 10. Despite some bugs in the squad AI its still a very enjoyable title and one of the most respectfully reallistic portrayals of infantry warfare.",First Reallistic  War Game EVER,1110240000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

This basically means I became pretty familiar with slamming into same-way traffic on instinct to earn boost, rack up traffic attack points, and take out unsuspecting rivals with flaming vehicular projectiles. Well, needless to say, you can't do that on Legends, as it's more of in the vein of the other entries in the Burnout series. It's a little more difficult to avoid cars anyway, because headlights/brakelights seem to pop up closer than on the console versions. However, the speed, sound, and sheer graphical beauty of this game is on par with the best looking PSP games out there (Tekken: DR being the high watermark).

Likewise, the controls are simple and intuitive in the classic arcade-racer way, and it's quite easy for vets and noobs alike to just pick it up and play. My only real complaint in the control department regards the aftertouch control in crash mode, which is much less responsive than the console Burnout games. This is frustrating when you're a couple thousand away from a gold, and all you need to do is hit that last trailer on the other side of the street, but for all your mighty struggling with the analog nub, the best you can do crawl to the dotted yellow line and expire in a sigh of exhaust fumes and flaming fuel tanks.

Decorate with assorted bullets and shells
Armchair soldiers of the world rejoice - at long last, a comprehensive and damn near exhaustive attempt at bringing large scale, semi-realistic 3D warfare to the PC.
Veterans of EA's Medal of Honor series will be right at home with the basic setup; grab one of five kit bags, with appropriate weapons and equipment from Medic to Scout and trudge off to war in a variety of landmark WW2 battles.  Where this game really starts to kick in is the quite spectacular scale of these engagements.
Fancy yourself a pilot?  Hop into the cockpit of a Spitfire and...well...spit fire at the enemy from the clouds.  Always enjoyed the rumble of heavy armor?  No problem, find a shiny new Tiger tank with the keys in the ignition.  Don't like getting your hands dirty?  Swivel the massive guns of a cruiser and rain artillery on the baddies.  There's so many amusing ways to frag your friends and neighbours you'll be hard pushed to find more variety in a 3D shooter.
While Battlefield does include a limited single player campaign, its in the online realms that this game really shines.  56k modem users may scrape by in the smaller battles, but you'll need a higher speed connection if you really want to get the most out of this game.  Battles can be up to 60 players, but personally I find the 32 player games hit the right balance between scale and teamwork...too many people, and you'll never find a spare tank to play with!
Graphically 1942 doesn't really break any new ground...its certainly not as crisp and detailed as Allied Assualt, but more than makes up for this with the massive size of the playing areas.  There's some nice details, such as the swaying trees and dust kicked up by tanks, but you'll probably be too busy ducking from .50 cal fire to notice.  The sound is great, with the crackle of machine guns and the whine of dive bombers filling the air.  There's also some nice animation from an infantry point of view, whipping out a new magazine for your Thompson carbine and slapping it home, or sneaking up behind an unsuspecting sentry and letting your knife do your talking.
On the downside this is a game that requires a fair deal of cooperation to be really fun...you will find yourself out numbered and outgunned more than once because your smacktard team is busy queing for planes on the other side of the map.
Things can get pretty dull in the single player campaign where the computer AI is sometimes less than helpful (fortunately there are several patches for this game that clean things up a bit)
But, when it all comes together you'll be whooping with joy as your tanks roll into the enemy base, supported by bombers and scout-directed artillery. The new Road to Rome expansion will certainly add new life to this game, plus the multitude of conversion mods that are available from the net, including the much talked about Desert Combat mod.
There's just so many different ways to play, you'll be shaking your head with the scope of this title.  It's so well balanced, from crawling through the bushes as a sniper to take pot-shots at artillery crews, to buzzing the treeline with your P-51 Mustang...from the squealing gears as your Panzer IV shifts its gun turret, to the frenzied house to house fighting in the dusty streets of Berlin.

4.0,False,"10 27, 2009",A2S1TF4OD00K53,B001PB9J14,Pete,"Being an avid Tekken fan, there isn't much that gets me more excited than another sequel in my favorite fighting franchise. I had been looking forward to this one for the past year or so when news was hitting about it's upcoming release and as usual, I put down my pre-order dollars and picked it up first day. After some time playing with it though, somethings bothering me.

For perspective, I fell in love with Tekken with the first in the arcade and it's by far, my favorite fighting franchise. I've played every Tekken to date, and played them to death. Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is my favorite and I believe the absolute best the series has to offer. So what's wrong with Tekken 6? I'm still not quite sure and that's what's bothering me.

Graphically, it looks very good, in fact the best it's ever looked, but somehow different. The characters have that next gen look about them but may be a little too shiny and bumpy for their own good. I have to admit though, the animations look incredible and very natural and lifelike. The stages are pretty good but nothing spectacular but feature some new break away floors and walls which is pretty cool. The pig sty stage is a real puzzler and is easily my least favorite of the bunch. The soundtrack is also pretty good but I still like Tekken 5 DR's much better. On all fronts though I have a real problem with the the end boss, stage and music. It all just seems so out of place that I have to remind myself I'm playing Tekken. They've tried these type of bosses before and for me, they just don't work. They're much more at home in Soul Calibur than Tekken. After the awesome Jinpachi in Tekken 5, this is a big let down.

Almost every character from the series has returned with a handful of new ones that all play pretty well and aren't totally out of place. I really don't like Lars and Leo though, they look very generic and are the least fun for me to use. I found Zafina to be the most fun of the bunch and the most natural addition with Bob being a close second. All my favorites still play well with some new moves that were fun to discover. The difficulty seems a little ramped up here and I found myself struggling more on medium level than I had in recent memory.

There are a ton of modes including a campaign mode that's like a 3D beat em up, but I personally don't care for it much. It's not fun and doesn't play well, look good and I don't appreciate that I have to go through it to get the characters endings instead of Story Mode which is oddly missing. This is also reminicent of Tekken 3 when they had a similar mode. There's also the standard vs, online, time attack and practice modes.

Like Tekken 5, there's rank promotions and gold to be earned through the campaign and arcade modes that'll enable you to customize your character to your liking. I like this feature in fighting games and I feel it really extends their life.

The oddest thing here is that I should be thrilled to be playing a new Tekken but I'm not. It looks and plays the same but somehow different. I can't quite put my finger on it. The best I can liken it to is when your favorite band comes out with a new album that's just not what you were expecting and your not sure how to feel about it. Tekken 6 is kinda the same and kinda different at the same time but not necessarily in the best way. I'm reminded of Tekken 4, many were put off by it but I didn't have a problem with it and enjoyed it just fine, but like Tekken 6, it was the first on a next generation console. Coincidence? I'm sure the same will be true here as it was with Tekken 4, some will love it while others may feel more like me. Either way, it's still a good game though and I'm gonna play it for a long time and hope it grows on me a little more. I still do recommend it to long time Tekken fans and maybe a rent for newcomers. I invite you to leave any comments on how you feel about it and why.

11/01/09 Update: After considerable playtime with Tekken 6 I believe the problem is a number of small changes that add up to a big difference for longtime vets. Graphically, I think T6 should look alot better but many of the stages are either very dark or the colors have been cranked up so much that much of the detail is lost. Sound wise, the soundtrack is ok but not among the best in the series. A couple of the tracks just sound weird. The Scenario Campaign, which is the 3D beat-em-up mode, seems to have taken center stage and was probably the focus of way to much time and energy on the part of Namco. After all the effort on their part, it doesn't even play well enough to justify the sacrifice. It's just not fun and it's not why we play Tekken. The biggest omission is the Story Mode that rewarded  us with a cool cinematic for each character. Their whole reason for being in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. After too many attempts to beat Azazel, the games disappointing final boss, I was rewarded with end credits. The cinematics are why we play through every character and now there isn't that motivation to do so anymore. The difficulty has been ramped up alot to the point of frustration on anything past ""EASY"", which isn't all that easy either. The last thing that stands out this year are the loading times. Even though they aren't that long, they've never shown up in previous Tekkens and I don't see the reason for it here. I found that installing the game to the hard drive helps but it takes up alot of memory and we shouldn't have to do it in the first place. We want our fighting games fast and ready to go. So that's it for me. It felt different from the first time I popped it in and played it but now I know why. I've accepted it and I'm gonna keep on playing it but I don't think it'll dethrone Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection as the true King of the Iron Fist.

I spent the majority of my time on M25 through a CCM with a friend and a TON of Ultimate Team, the most MUT I have ever played in the series.  The core game of M25 was solid on the last gen systems (odd that I am now calling PS3/360 as last gen now).  The Connected Career and Ultimate Team were great, and are still great on the PS4 as nothing has really been changed, except unfortunately GameFace is not on the next gen systems.  That is a little disappointing because it is really cool to see your mug on either a coach or owner.

The key differences on the PS4 version come from performance and visuals, but most of all game play.  The visuals are stunning.  The menus are slick, and I really like the dark theme to them.  They are responsive and fast to load unlike in the PS3/360.  One key difference, in MUT, you'd have to sit there for a little while for your cards to load in your lineup, but on the PS4, they are probably a good 3x faster to load.  That is huge when you're trying to navigate things in Ultimate Team.

The performance and visuals also translate onto the field as well.  The game is beautiful, especially close up shots that you can use your PS4 to take pictures of now and share.  Now only does it look pretty, but the gameplay is also more refined than it was on the PS3, and it is really making the game enjoyable.

The key thing with the first entry of Madden in the new generation of consoles is the fact that EA didn't repeat the same mistake they made with Madden 06.  Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, they took what they had and made it better.

4.0,False,"11 15, 2005",AQU2FAI5VKE91,B0009OO6XO,Jonathan Kim,"I purchased this game because I enjoy tennis and figured I would probably enjoy a tennis game. The World Tour portion of the game is probably the most fun part of owning the game.

The World Tour - The Meat and Potatos of Single Player

Creating a player for the World Tour isn't as indepth as I would've liked, but it does a good enough job. You create both a male and a female character and can switch between the two to raise their stats. To raise your stats you must play mini games that increase your skills in serving, volleying, footwork, etc. You gain experience for the minigames and, depending on what skills you used more over the course of the game, your skills go up. Completed challenges give multipliers to the experience so it behooves you to win.

To raise money, you can play in tournaments. You start ranked last at 300 and then slowly make your way up as you win tournaments. Tournaments are much quicker than real life tournaments (thankfully). Most usually consist of a few ""best 2 out of 3"" matches. Doubles tournaments require you to spend your winnings on contracts and pairing up with some of the top tennis players. The computer controlled players actually did way better than me... which was kind of disconcerting.

The game was very entertaining from a tennis fan's point of view though there were two issues that I had with the game that keep it from getting that last star.

General Gameplay Issues

The first issue I had was the overall sluggishness of the interface. There was constant loading in every part of the game. Starting from the create a player interface to the world map where you choose what to do. And it just slowed down the process. It would've been nice if failed attempts at minigames would give you a prompt to see if you wanted to try it again instead of reloading the world map and having to reload the levels again. Though the fact that i would play the same minigame over 10 times in a row should show how addictive it can become. The slowness may be attributed to the firmware version 1.52 that i had installed (ver. 2.00+ is out), and I don't have another PSP to try the game out on.

The second minor issue I had was with the minigames. True, they're fun and addictive, but they don't really change much as the game continues. The levels remain the same. They just add a few more objectives and keep the time limits the same. Some just seemed extremely difficult given the lack of control you have in the beginning.. but they were still keeping me coming back for more so I suppose the issue isn't as big a deal. But the difficulty coupled with the loading times were an annoyance worth mentioning.

Conclusion

I recommend the purchase to anybody wanting a decent tennis game to play on the go (The tiny ball on the screen sometimes gets hard to track). Otherwise you'd probably be better off buying a console version of Top Spin (better graphics and faster loading).","Fun, but some slight issues",1132012800,11,,

To everyone's surprise the actual Crackdown game turned out to be a very fun (if somewhat flawed) open world action game.

In Crackdown one plays a genetically enhanced super solider called The Agent for an organization called The Agency run by a disembodied voice known as The Director. Through both your actions and the collection of orbs you increase your powers to the point that you are a true bad ass jumping around the city (surprisingly not called The City, naming things not being Realtime Worlds' strong suit).

The game's city consisting of three islands each controlled by a different gang with your headquarters on a forth smaller island in the middle. The gangs are Los Muertos (Your standard South American Drug Cartel), The Volk (Your standard Russian Mafia), and The Shai-Gen Corporation ( which represents Sony).

The graphics are a colorful cell-shaded affair that fits surprisingly well with the chaos and the ever more outrageous powers you will achieve. The sound (with one notable exception detailed below) is also quite good with the hum of the agility orbs almost being hypnotic (and yes you will see agility orbs in your daily life and hear the hum in your sleep.)

There are a couple of bits of genius in Crackdown. The first and most obvious is the combining of item collection and powers. The powers are more than mere stat boosts as there are both visible (You crackle with electricity when you level up a core power ) and quite fun (You can roundhouse kick a mack truck and leap from skyscraper to skyscraper).

The other brilliant move is the structure. In the game you are tasked with taking out the three gangs as you see fit. Each gang consists of a boss and various sub-bosses that specialize in various tasks for their boss (Such as training bodyguards or providing weapons). By taking out the sub-bosses you weaken a certain part of the bosses defenses therefore making him an easier target. It's a brilliant structure that gives a real sense of accomplishment in a open world environment.

The game also doesn't skimp on weapons with the harpoon gun and the five shot at a time homing grenade launcher being particular favorites.

It is a good thing that Crackdown is such well structured and fun game, because the game certainly has a bunch of flaws that easily would be game-breakers in almost any other adventure.

For starters there is combat. There is a reason my Agent maxed out his punch people in the face ability first. Now hand to hand combat has its own set of issues. (Mainly facing the wrong way and missing enemies outright while jamming the B button.) Compared however to the auto-aim on guns, hand to hand combat is of a Street Fighter II Turbo caliber.

Auto-aim has two favorite targets: civilian vehicles and dead guys. Crackdown loves shooting dead guys, perhaps as a forerunner to the zombies in Crackdown 2 one might muse. Getting your targeting off the dead guy and onto the guy with a rocket launcher is surprisingly challenging. In addition Crackdown allows you to target specific parts of a person or vehicle. The game in theory allows one to blow up a car with a well aimed shot to the gas tank. Getting the cursor to the gas tank part of the car however seems to be a case of random hit or miss. Often the game simply won't let you target that part of the vehicle even if you a clearly facing it.

Fortunately the above mentioned homing grenade launcher renders many of these problems somewhat mute towards the end of the game. Though they still seem to pop up every once in a while.

Part of the games challenge is making seemingly impossible jumps to grab onto a distant ledge. Unfortunately sometimes a ledge looks like a ledge, quacks like a ledge and yet your agent proceeds to plummet eighty stories to his demise. While the parkour in Crackdown is fun, and one of the games selling points, it isn't what I would call fine tuned.

Speaking of both out of tune and poorly tuned we have the vehicles. Driving is one of your abilities in Crackdown and in theory when one reaches the highest level ones car becomes a super powered monster. I say in theory because there is actually no need to power this up to defeat the game. In fact once your all important agility power has a few stars under its belt, cars are simply superfluous since you can now jump from rooftop to rooftop.

And thank God for that. For such a relatively small map Crackdown's streets are a confusing labyrinth. To add to the mess the in-game map has no custom waypoints. Strangely, The Agency claims they want you to capture enemy vehicles and bring them back to headquarters. However the entrance to headquarters is unmarked on your map, almost impossible to find and is disguised on top of that like the Bat-Cave entrance from the caped crusader's sixties TV show.

In addition the way you increase your driving skill is by winning races (easier said than done and hardly a fun pastime in this particular game) or running over gang members. Gang members however seem to metamorphosis into Cirque du Soleil performers the minute one points a car in their general direction.

The final nail in the driving coffin is the in game radio. One of the joys of open world games is simply cruising around the city listening to the radio. I would purchase a downloadable version of GTA Vice City right now (Hint hint Rockstar) just to cruise the streets of faux Miami in a red convertible listening to the tunes.

Per Wikipedia: Music supervisor Peter Davenport was in charge of selecting the music for the game, over 100 tracks of electronica and sample-based music by a number of independent and video game musicians, a task that took three years to complete. Per Videogame Musings: it is the worst collection of ""music"" I simply have ever heard. Each song is worse than the last and if I would have to guess Peter Davenport's IPod is currently the torture device of choice at various CIA black prisons around the world.

Thankfully, despite the control problems, some features either missing or broken, and a soundtrack from the depths of hell, Crackdown scores high in that hard to define fun factor category and when it comes to games that is always the deciding factor.",Crackdown scores high in that hard to define fun factor category,1280361600,,,
4.0,True,"10 13, 2011",A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B001BP4JY6,D.G.M.,"I know I'm a bit late to the roller coaster ride known as Ninja Gaiden, but I finally made it. Ever since I played Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening I've used that game's difficulty as a benchmark to which I compare the difficulty of other games. I have several games that range from challenging to difficult, such as Jak II, Jak 3, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Prototype, and of course the original Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 4. However, none of those games came close to the extreme difficulty of DMC 3... but then along came Ninja Gaiden Sigma. I've never played the X-box version, so if you want comparisons between that one and the PS3 version, then look somewhere else. Anyway, this game is as hard as the legends say, a close cousin to DMC 3. Ninja Gaiden Sigma is all about relentless, brutal, fast paced, in your face action that will constantly demand players to be at the top of their game; the second you slow yourself down or relax... you're dead. You are Ryu Hayabusa, wielder of the legendary Dragon Sword and leader of the Hayabusa Ninja Clan, and after his village is decimated by evil forces, Ryu goes on his quest to retrieve the stolen Dark Dragon Blade and take his revenge on those who have royally pissed him off. The story is your basic cookie-cutter affair which was quite literally just tacked on to this game for necessity's sake.

There's basically no character development and the plot is thinner than a reality t.v. modeling contestant. You'll find more story elements in the game manual than in the actual game itself, and Ryu literally has only about 10 to 15 lines of dialogue in the game... the ENTIRE game. But I knew going in that the focus of NGS was the gameplay, so I won't hold the lack of story against it. Ryu is a deadly, modern day ninja who is a master of weaponry and ninpo (ninja magic), but his enemies are just as deadly. He'll fight other ninjas, samurais, soldiers, cyborgs, and ugly monsters known as Fiends; and they're all a bunch of supreme jerks. Knowing when to stop attacking and then go to blocking and dodging are the keys to survival in this game, and it must be done with PRECISE timing. From the lowliest enemy soldier to the most powerful of Fiends, all the enemies in this game will beat the crap out of you repeatedly, until you pick up their patterns and learn when to slash and bash them to pieces. Ryu is certainly not short on weaponry with which to do terrible things to his enemies: he'll have a sword, twin swords, a staff, flails, shurikens, a bow and arrows (normal and explosive), and more. He'll also use his ninja magic to attack enemies with fire, ice, and lightning spells.

You also play a few missions as Rachel, a Fiend Hunter with a large hammer and a pair of honkers that are nearly just as large. Her attacks typically do more damage than Ryu's, but she's also comparatively slower, plus she can't wall run like Ryu can. Out of the 19 chapters in this game, you only play as Rachel for about 4 of them, which was enough. Even though Rachel's strong, her more limited mobility and the fact that she only has one main weapon makes it easier for enemies to adapt to her attacks and get around them. Ryu's many different weapons offer him numerous styles of attacks and certain weapons work better against certain enemies, making him a superior warrior all around. Aside from slaying enemies, NGS has many puzzles for players to tackle, most of them involving finding special items to activate machinery and open doors. Since several of the levels you go through are interconnected and the game isn't always very specific about what your next goal is or where your next destination lies, you may find yourself getting lost from time to time. As difficult as this game is, it probably wouldn't have been quite so infuriating if the camera wasn't out to get you just as much as your enemies. It can be adjusted most of the time, but other times it is fixed... unfavorably. Several times, especially during the boss battles, Ryu was knocked towards the camera, then he disappeared from sight and was ruthlessly pummeled offscreen. Even during a couple of the platforming sections of this game the camera annoyingly looks away from the next spot you need to jump or wall run to, usually leading to Ryu falling into a conveniently placed pool of liquid hot MAG-MA!

Even learning how to properly make Ryu dodge and jump correctly takes time to get used to, but once you do it makes things easier (somewhat). Save points are frequent enough that even when you die, you normally won't have to replay too much before you get back to where you were killed. I was greatly annoyed however at how the game no longer gives you access to an upgrade statue in which to buy things like health items and arrows during the last two missions, even though you fight many enemies and bosses in a row. Also, the fact that Ryu is unable to absorb soul essences from fallen enemies while he is blocking and attacking is just plain stupid since you really need that stuff to gain health, magic, and currency. Those are just downright sadistic gameplay mechanics. Again, much like Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, Ninja Gaiden Sigma is brutally difficult and cheap, but it can be very rewarding when you're finally able to defeat the very tough enemies that are thrown at you. So all in all, this game is fun and has lots of cool looking characters and enemies, with plenty of fantastical ninja swordplay. NGS is not for casual gamers and is more fit for hardcore masochists; I fall somewhere between casual and hardcore, so if you're like me, it's probably better that you play this game only if you're a big fan of ninjas and action games in general. Either way, be wary.",Learn the ways of the ninja... or suffer many frustrating deaths,1318464000,2,,

4.0,False,"09 10, 2004",A3PVM541IR8EYE,B0002BID5Q,Doug Urquhart,"I loved the original Dark Fall. There is something inherently creepy about an abandoned railway station, and the game exploited this to the full.

There's also something inherently creepy about a lighthouse. Apart from the isolation, the steel and stone contruction leads to 'eldrich' noises as the structure heats and cools. (Experienced keepers often used this to great effect, to put the wind up rookies and the occasional visitor.)

As the game began, I was expecting a ghost story set in 1912, in the lighthouse.

[I don't believe there are any spoilers ahead, but stop now if you are worried]

I was slightly disappointed to find that the story involved time travel, and before I knew where I was, I had been transported to the present day. The present-day section was a closely-observed comment on the way we treat our landmarks - a gift shop full of junk and inaccurate history books, with the working parts of the lighthouse preserved in a museum. Depressing, but accurately observed.

There was also a future section, where corporate paeons had unleashed a problem for previous generations without really caring very much. Again closely observed, but depressing.

The game is utterly non-linear, which is a refreshing change.

Just a minor technical quibble - the game messes with the refresh rate on the monitor. Unfortunately it doesn't restore it at the end of the game. Even more unfortunately, it chooses to set the rate to 60Hz - line frequency in the US -which maximizes screen flicker. I assume this is a side effect of  being developed in the UK. Dark Fall did the same. Please don't do it next time, guys.

By the way, I realize that the game was produced by a very small group, but it would really help matters if at least one of you could write correct English; the misplaced apostrophes became really annoying after a while.

To sum up: I quite enjoyed the game but it didn't have the atmosphere of the original.","Closely observed, but no atmosphere",1094774400,18,,

 The plot plays out like an H.P. Lovecraft story including taking place on the grounds of  an ancient , sprawling manor in Scotland during the years  immediately after WWI . and involves the fates of 5 siblings who , in their youth , went out to a small storm-swept island just off the coast but still within their ancestral property where a circle of ancient celtic standing stones had been erected. There they .... did what no-one should do , then paid individually with their sanity , humanity , and lives ,  Aarons fate was truly Clive Barkian and freaked me out when I had to face him , the first couple minutes of battle I spent just frantically backing away from him as he was so freaky looking I didn't want to have to have a close-up look at him. The atmosphere of the old sprawling manor was very effective and drew me in to the game world. The levels were competently developed , the human enemies fit the narrative and the supernatural creatures are all creepy . The weapons are all pretty fun as well but in this game you really had to consider your arsenal before going into a violent environment , no storming a darkened room with a geeky 'battle-cry' a firing off a minigun , the reloads for both the shotgun and revolver are dangerously time consuming and the Tibetan War Cannon ,though it has unlimited uses , only kills some foes but not others. The end game boss was pretty lame , with all the dark atmosphere I was really expecting something more nightmarish ...which is why this game isn't 5 stars. Another curiosity is that as you go through the halls and rooms of the largely deserted mansion you naturally have to try every door you encounter as you don't know which ones advance the plot but when you try a locked door you get to to hear ""aaarrggh  its stukk"" or some variation , this itself isn't n issue nor is hearing that phrase dozens of times to the point where you can mimic Patricks ( the hero you play) speaking style , I still use that phrase from time to time :) Im not complaining about that though and it doesnt take away from a great , absorbing game experience.

I've just started, but I think I've got a pretty good handle on the way this game will play out.  As you enter your weight, the little stick figure will get bigger (if you're...bigger...).  Mine started frowning and her stomach was starting to knock the scale over.  It's a little sad to look at, but it's not untrue.  It will tell you to drink a glass of water, then take a five minute walk (500 steps), then put your salt shaker in the cupboard.  The steps, at least at this point, are very small, but these, done over a period of time, will have a huge impact.  I'm a nurse and not an idiot, so I KNOW how to lose weight, but we all need someone pushing us.  In fact, I used to work at a weight loss clinic.  It wasn't the program so much as the accountability.

Pros:  It starts out small.  I quit most weight loss plans early because I try to tackle too many poor lifestyle habits at once.  It didn't say ""drink 64 ounces of water today and every day for the rest of your life.""  It just said to go drink a big glass of water.  One of my physical challenges was to do ten lunges.  I'm out of shape enough that it got my heart rate up, but it wasn't enough to wear me out.  It wasn't enough to discourage me from doing it tomorrow.  The interactivity of it will be a huge benefit.  I have a shelf full of work out DVDs that would probably work wonders, but I don't have any ongoing encouragement to put them in.  Results are never immediate, so it helps to have someone (even if it's a stick figure) to encourage you and even reward you for coming back.  In fact, I might actually pull some of those DVDs off the shelf so that I can get in some of the physical activity the game asks me to do.

Cons: Like some other reviewer mentioned, the game does not give enough options for entering food intake.  For example: my first day, I had two pieces of pizza.  Pizza is listed, but it's not specific what kind of pizza.  Thin crust frozen pizza is undoubtedly lower in calories than the doughy, greasy pizza I had from Papa John's.  You kind of have to pick and choose from what's available and come up with the closest thing you can.  It's a little frustrating, but relatively minor.  For more accurate tracking, I'd check out [...].  If this program let you enter in an unlisted food by calories/fat/etc, it'd be a huge improvement.  The other significant con is that there aren't enough personalization options.  One challenge was to drink a glass of warm milk before bed.  The challenges are all optional, but it'd be nice to input food allergies/intolerances (like a lactose intolerance) to prevent those challenges from appearing.  Along the same lines, it encourages walking, which is GREAT if you don't live in an area like mine.  When it told me to walk 500 steps, I walked the hallway of my apartment complex ten times.  It's not entirely safe in my neighborhood, and I'm not going out there by myself.  Case closed.  It also encourages you to walk to the grocery store.  Not gonna happen.  I don't feel like ending up on the evening news. What I'll end up doing on the days I don't work will be to drive to a safer area.

I'll update this if I have any new observations while using it.  Good luck!",Great for beginners,1248998400,6,,

Both do a good job of entertaining players with realistic environments, monstrous adversaries and compelling storylines.  But Silent Hill takes the creepiness factor to a much higher level.  Unless you're an incredibly desensitized individual Silent Hill 3 will certainly freak you out.
SH3's storyline has strong ties to the first game; a fact which should thrill fans of the series.  The plot starts out a little sparse but fleshes out toward the end.  Compared to Silent Hill 2's story SH3's is easily understood.  But remember, this is the world of Silent Hill...expect to devote some brain power to comprehend everything.
Sound effects and ambiance are where the Silent Hill series shine and this installment is the best yet.  The audio does exactly what it needs to do with eerie effectiveness.  You'll hear things in the distance, unearthly noises will appear unexpectedly, and the sound of inhuman creatures (whether they're killing or being killed) is...gruesome.
The only thing I would have preferred, and this might sound strange, is more horror.  With all the sights and sounds encountered throughout SH3 there are precious few occurrences where something actually appears to justify the tension!  I think the developers missed a lot of opportunities to maximize the game's potential and really frighten the wits out of players.  The first two Silent Hills had the same problem so I doubt Konami will improve this factor in future installments.  Oh well, I suppose perfection is too much to ask for.
There are many reasons to play through Silent Hill 3 multiple times, such as unlocking more selectable options, equipping alternate outfits for the main character Heather, using fantastic new weapons, and viewing different endings.

Story

In a time when Humanity flourished, machines known simply as the `Children of Ymir' emerged from the depths of the Earth, bent on the destruction of all sentient beings and have waged war on the Human race for the past thousand years. This war has left the planet icy, cold and nearly inhospitable resulting in the death of all but a few million humans. These humans prayed to the Aesir and worship the ODIN (Organically Distributed Intelligence Network) and were blessed by the Gods, who sheltered the few remaining humans in an enclave known as Midgard.

Graphics

The graphics in Too Human are what you'd expect from a game that came out half way through the consoles life, they look good but aren't hyper realistic like Halo, Call of Duty or Elder Scrolls. They relate more to Dead Rising, Crackdown or Saint's Row. All in all, the graphics are standard, nothing special, nothing good or bad.

Controls

Usually controls are tough to talk about due to them usually being so generic, Too Human is different in this way. The left thumbstick moves Baldur around, but to attack, you lean the right stick in the direction you want to attack and tapping to launch enemies with melee weapons. Guns can be tough to control, especially if you're using two at a time so practice is needed with them. Rifles are capable of launching grenades which is very helpful against groups of enemies. If you can adjust to these controls, you'll have a lot of fun with the game, just give it some time.

Music/Sound/Voice

Sadly, there is little of all of them in the game, in-between fights you'll be listening to little or nothing at all. Only when in combat do you hear anything, and honestly, the music is nothing special. Sound effects seem to be repeated after a bit, but switching what you do can alleviate that issue pretty quick (don't use the same move over and over and over and over).

Other

The game can be very difficult at times, especially on higher difficulties; enemies will have various immunities at all times on tougher levels, making strategy mandatory. So mastering this game can be tough, but is very rewarding as you'll get some of the best armor and weapons.
The one thing that REALLY stands out is the ability to customize Baldur after a certain point, you can change his armor color, bonus stats and weapon effects, as well as a few other things I won't mention.

The multiplayer is pretty well done as well, I never had any issues with players joining my game and it is always fun to play hack & slash games with a friend. This can either make the game tougher or easier, depending on the skill of the players.

Achievements: A good chunk of the achievements will come naturally, some of the others will require skill (beat the 4 levels WITHOUT dying), patience (obtain 10,000 drops) and luck (complete a full set of Epic gear). With time, you should be able to get them though.

Overall

Too Human is a fun game if given a chance, best played with a friend and not for the weak of heart.

8.5/10.0

Pros
- Norse Mythology driven story (kinda)
- Ability to customize is great
- Tough game that's rewarding

Cons
- Steep learning curve
- Will give many players a headache

4.0,False,"07 17, 2009",A2YAABMT80RLYA,B001SHCFES,Ben Rowland,"I have been a gamer all my life, starting with the Atari 2600 and moving on from there, so the question of whether or not I was going to purchase a next-gen console was never an ""if"", it was a ""when"" and ""what"". I started with the Wii and that satisfied some of my needs, but I also wanted a system capable of high definition graphics and more immersive gameplay. After researching the pros and cons of both the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, I elected to go with the 360 for a variety of reasons. This review will cover my impressions on the Xbox 360 Elite (Red Console with the Jasper Chip) which I purchased in April 2008.

Pros:

1. Quality and quantity of games. For all the debating about which system is better in terms of technical specs, it's easy to lose sight of what is most important; the games. I would buy the PS3 for ""Killzone 2"" and ""Metal Gear Solid 4"", but games like ""Halo 3"", ""Fable 2"", ""Gears of War"", and ""Left 4 Dead"" are more appealing to me.  With the quality of the exclusive titles plus the wide array of great cross-platform games, the 360 was an easy choice.

2. Best online experience. Sure, you need to pay for a ""Gold"" account on Xbox Live, but you get what you pay for. I have seen the PSN and it pales in comparison to Xbox Live in terms of customizability, user-friendliness, and the quality of online gaming. I have also found that more of my friends own Xbox 360 consoles and therefore more people are online for me to play with.

3. Xbox Live Arcade. In addition to the retail titles available, there are many great games available for download from the Live Arcade. These range from older Xbox titles to online puzzle games like ""Peggle"" and ""Zuma"" (both of which are highly addictive). I was also stoked that they have ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" available for download.

4. Best value. In terms of the console price compared to the frills, you get better value for your money with the Xbox 360 than you do with the PS3 or the Wii. They is always some kind of package deal being offered, usually with a packed in game as well as other bonuses like a headset or an Xbox Live subscription.

Having spoken about the strengths of the console, I cannot deny that there are some cons that should be taken into consideration when buying the Xbox 360. However, none of the below points have made me regret purchasing the console.

Cons.

1. Reliability. You can't dance around the fact that the Xbox 360 console is notorious for malfunctioning. Freezes, scratched discs, and the dreaded ""Red Ring of Death"" made me apprehensive at first. Microsoft has extended their warranty to help cover these issues, but I think you should be able to enjoy your games without worrying about the system dying. I was fairly late in adopting the console, so I have not had any of the problems that seemed to plague the earlier models (Arcade and Pro).

2. Overheating. Playing the system for even a short time causes the console to get very hot. The new Elite models are supposed to be less prone to overheating due to the reduced energy use, but it still gets pretty toasty. My recommendation is to buy a console fan (such as the Intercooler) and make sure the console has plenty of room the breathe.

3. As a result of the system overheating, Microsoft has seen fit to install very loud fans in the back of the console, so loud that they sound like a vacuum being run. This is annoying to say the least.

4. No Wireless Internet. Unlike the Wii and the PS3, the 360 does not come with an integrated wireless card; it must be purchased as an external peripheral. If you use wired internet, you're in luck as there is an Ethernet port on the back.

I bought my 360 fairly late in the console's production cycle, therefore I have not experienced any serious issues as of yet. I have not had my system freeze, no ""red disco lights of death"" have come up, and outside of a few small annoyances, I have been quite happy with my purchase. It has the best games for me and it offers the best online experience, and I would recommend it on those strengths alone.",The quality of the games and the online experience make the 360 my console of choice.,1247788800,,{'Edition:': ' Resident Evil 5 Elite Red'},
4.0,False,"09 9, 2004",AINWD4W4NMO4Q,B0002HLKIC,Brian Forrester,"I'll give a basic Pro/Con rundown of the game's qualities:

Pro:

- Excellent graphics.

- Excellent gameplay.

- ""The Crib"" beats the heck out of Madden Cards.

- Similar control configuration to Madden, lessens the learning curve.  Then again, you could simply configure your controls how you see fit, so I guess this is a wash.

- Tons of gameplay options.

- First Person Football is a true challenge!

- Wide variety of customization options (music selections, etc.)

- Fantastic play-by-play.

- Fantastic pre, haftime, and post game coverage.

Cons:

- Some annoying glitches.  The game has frozen on me a few times

after calling a timeout on the field.

- Lack of lineup flexibility.  I tried to put in an outside linebacker into the middle linebacker position and could not do so.  You can't even edit a player's position, look, etc. in the Franchise mode (if at all) outside of college players.  Don't players routinely change positions later in their careers, especially defensive backs (Rod Woodson going from corner to safety, for example)?

- The running game is a bit too easy.  On 5 minute games on Pro difficulty, I routinely break off multiple 70+ yard runs a game.

- The soundtrack kind of sucks.  Where Madden has established artists on their soundtrack, ESPN has artists that I've never heard of.  Then again, I'm not exactly up to date on the musical scene.

Overall, I actually like playing this game more than Madden.  The graphics are better (players actually look like themselves), and the overall game is just more fun to play.  Some of the glitches get to me, but they've been few and far between thus far.  For $20, you can't lose.","Great game, room for improvement",1094688000,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},
4.0,False,"06 17, 2008",A3QQU0665R5YYK,B000XJO7A2,Karrigan Ambrian,"THE GOOD:

Great graphics, the gameplay has been HUGELY improved from the original, and the story is interesting. It definitely feels more supernatural than the first one, because they hit you with the mental stuff right off the bat. So right away, this game feels like the awesome, hallucinaton-filled second half of the first game. That's a very good sign.  It goes back to ""reality"" a few chapters in, and the hallucinations/supernatural elements become less common, but it's still fun.

The combat is fun - some people say it's become too easy to beat down on the thugs, and so it takes away from the suspense...but it's fine with me, because 1.) It's not THAT easy to beat up the thugs, you're still on your toes, plus they often attack in packs, and 2.) Story-wise, it makes sense. Ethan's been through so much, he *should* have learned to fight better since the original. So instead of feeling cheap when you're doing a Chain attack on someone, you feel awesome and powerful.

The investigation segments...gah, they're so much better it's ridiculous. Instead of just finding the victim's wound and taking a picture, you have to decide whether they were stabbed or shot; whether it's an entry wound or exit wound, etc. It's awesome.

Now, for...

THE BAD:

The environments you explore are reminiscent of the first game - run-down, deserted buildings.  You spend more time outside in the city, which I don't particularly like...at least in the first game, you could pretend that the outside world is ""normal"", that you're really exploring a deserted department store in a real city.  In this game, you're often outside, and the city is ridiculously deserted and the sky is green.  Stupid.

It has more cutscenes...more cutscenes that either try to show how ""cool"" Ethan is, or cutscenes that make you think ""What the hell just happened?"" For example....*MINOR SPOILERS*....I found a body, took some pictures, thinking how fun that was. I had been with two cops, and we got separated, so I had to tell them the number of the room I was in. And then suddenly a cutscene started which showed those two cops running with the body on a bridge, with Ethan running after them at the head of a gang of thugs. One of the cops turned and shot some electrical box that made a line of fire block the bridge, so Ethan and the thugs had to stop. It wasn't until the ""good"" cop cried ""Ethan's still back there!"" that I realized Ethan was NOT suddenly aligned with the thugs. It was just a stupid-looking cutscene, and something you'd never find in the first game.

Anyways, the constant moves from gameplay to action-packed cutscene are jarring and pretty much kills any of the lonely, mysterious atmosphere the first game had.

Another thing I just don't like is the ""upgrade"" system. If you find things throughout the level (like the dead birds from the first game), you get Mission Points. Do good enough on a Mission (chapter), and you get an Upgrade. Stuff like bullet-proof vests, silver knuckles, etc. It sounds cool...but I kind of like the idea of surviving with whatever you can find in the environment, and getting upgrades that, well, make sense with the game world. It's ridiculous to jump off a roof in Chapter 2, and land in the factory in Chapter 3 with a brand-new bulletproof vest. It feels like it came straight out of a videogame from 1995.

So...overall I think it's still a good game, and I think it's worth $30, but not $60.  It seems to have the ""Prince of Persia 2"" syndrome. It's like the marketing people didn't like the sales of the first game, so they made Monolith put in ""more action"" and stuff like that.  Although at $30, it's kind of tough to go wrong when you know what you're getting into.","More action and cutscenes, less atmosphere",1213660800,4,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
4.0,False,"12 14, 2014",A2SXL0NDPTP9X9,B0095D1CM8,Andrew Clausen,"Pro:
1)  Matte texture helps to keep sweaty palms happy, also doesn't develop a microcosm of teeny tiny scratches like shiny plastic.
2)  Shape is very, very adjustable.
3)  Reprogrammable buttons can be mapped to do anything.
4)  Hinged left and right mouse buttons provide good click feedback.
5)  Already a heavy and solid mouse with steel base, more weight can be added.
6)  Adjustable palm rest allows for comfortable switch between claw and palm style grips.
7)  Adjustable DPI switch is customizable and easy to access.
8)  No silicone based rubber parts, the rubber parts are of a denser type and deteriorate from friction, sweat and body heat.
9)  The build quality is actually pretty good, and it comes in a nice box that I keep around to house the other accessories.
10) Adjustable size lets me change the shape of the mouse to keep my hand from cramping by allowing me to rest it in different positions from time to time.

Con:
1)  Small non-stick pads on the underside of the mouse.  I'm going to need some replacements after a year of heavy use.
2)  Software is not 100% stable, it will crash and become non-responsive from time to time or fail to activate a profile.
3)  Mouse firmware is a little half baked, the pointer will get stuck traveling along a single axis from time to time.  Flipping the mouse over and exposing the laser sensor to a non-surface for a moment seems to break it out of this behavior.
4)  I can't seem to tighten the angle adjustment on the thumb rest down, it always seems to retreat back to the mouse when I apply enough pressure to active the red aim-assist button.
5)  The components that are plastic and not colored black are painted (save for the red button), which my sweaty palms quickly liberated of their color.
6)  Unlike the Steel Series Sensi, the profile you set is not saved on the mouse.  If you close the mouse software, if it crashes or if you plug the mouse into a different computer your profiles will be lost and the mouse will return to its factory settings.

Other Thoughts:
1)  It looks pretty cool, but not completely with that gritty obnoxious gamer aesthetic.  Function comes (mostly) first actually making the mouse comfortable to use, then its cool form comes through with some (mostly sensible) sci-fi aesthetics.
2)  The stainless steel knobs will eventually develop a patina (light rust) from prolonged exposure to skin oils.  Some people hate this, but personally I find my things come to have a good character when they show signs of gentle and careful use.
3)  The inside is also sensibly designed, that took me by surprise as I took mine apart one day to remove a bit of grit that had gotten stuck in the way of the laser sensor.  I've no idea if this really matters to anyone but I thought it worth mentioning.
4)  You can program three sets of macros and switch between them by pressing the lighted button next to the left mouse button.  Its way more awesome than you would initially imagine.  I've got a profile for web browsers where the thumb wheel switches tabs... and another for productivity work where the thumb wheel is bound to undo/redo and the red aim assist button activates ctrl-s to save my work.
5)  Braided mouse cord isn't for everyone.  I like it because it doesn't kink up or get stuck on something behind my desk like rubber cables tend to do.
6)  If you are like me you actually notice input lag from your computer peripherals, well this mouse doesn't annoy me with huge amounts of input lag, it isn't as good as the Steel Series Sensi, but its still better than a cheapo mouse or a wireless travel mouse.

A perfect balance between Socom-type stealth/weaponry and very creative espionage missions.  The computer hacking/lock picking/alarm deactivating in this game were very well thought out and very rewarding when done properly.  The variety of weapons is amazing, and each one has advantages and disadvantages depending on the mission type.  There are some levels that you can run and gun your way through, but some where you will be killed in seconds if you try that approach.

Your decisions during conversations impact the game play more than on just a superficial level, and the decisions are never obvious as in games like Fallout III.  Overall, I believe any gamer should give this one a rental.  If you're not caught up within ten minutes you may never be, so it's a quick assessment.  I was swept away after the first mission.  The only reason I didn't award five stars was due to some AI stupidity (I played on normal though, not difficult).  Some enemy soldiers are very intelligent and some are mindless zombies, it's nice to keep you on your toes but the stupid ones sometimes run right passed you and not see you standing there.  I imagine on the difficult setting this wouldn't happen.  But it really evens out b/c the intelligent guards will sometimes shoot at you and sometimes bum rush you and beat the heck out of you.

The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom).

5.0,True,"04 30, 2011",A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003QX4F7C,Jason Bean,"The Yakuza games appeal to a very particular audience. None of the them really push the boundries of graphics and the sandbox-ish worlds they present feel very contained when compared to GTA or Saints Row. What the Yakuza games DO excel at (sometimes more so than their american counterparts) is style, character developement and adreneline-fueled hand-to-hand combat. Yakuza 4 is easily (in my opinion) the best of the series and manages to polish it's gameplay up a bit while adding a few new elements to make it stand on it's own.

The story of Yakuza 4 is soap-opera/crime-thriller that involves a mysterious woman named Lili whose connected to a series of deaths in Tokyo's Red Lights district. As with previous installments, this game is very cut-scene heavy with lots of (well-acted) dialogue which can test your patience. The cut-scenes are a lot more engaging (with a lot more action!), this time around though and I didn't feel quite as bored as I did in Yakuza 3. Just as long as cut-scenes are the blocks of text you have to click through to move that action forward. Again, it's much better paced than the previous games but still a bit annoying.

The biggest difference between Yakuza 4 and it's predecessors is the main character (or characters). Series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is now one of FOUR controllable characters and he's only playable towards the end. Being a series fan I was a bit disappointed with this change as I'd gotten pretty attatched to Kaz, but that opinion quickly changed when first protagonist Shun Akiyama is introduced. Not only is this loan-shark (along with the corrupt cop Tanimura and convict Taiga Saejima ) just as fun to play as Kaz, I was actually MORE vested in these new characters than our usual hero and didn't WANT to stop playing them. Luckly by the end of the game their stories come together and you can switch between them at will.

The graphics and the Yakuza games have never been their strong suit. The cut-scenes obviously look fantastic as do the main character models but the in-game environments still look like early PS3/late-PS2 graphics. There's still a lot of animations and colors in buildings and other structures and there's always a varied amount of people walking around which add to the game's immersion.

The gameplay, despite some slow-down is better than ever in Yakuza 4! As usual combat takes place in these enclosed arenas where you're forced to beat up a group of enemies. Each main character controls perfectly and responsively with each bone-crunching punch/kick/throw being felt. The hostess clubs are back (and even work into a main character's narrative) as is mahjong, gambling, karaoke, erotic massages etc. There is so much to do in this game world that really adds to the flavor of being in Japan and really makes Yakuza 4 so much fun to play.

I could go on and on about the things I love about Yakuza 4. It isn't perfect and like the other Yakuza games is an aquired taste. However, if you loved the previous enstallments as much as I do or are looking for a great noir-thriller game with a japanese twist definitely give Yakuza 4 a shot!

(a note: I realise this is the fourth game in the series but newbies shouldn't worry about starting from the first game. This story stands very well on it's own and only somewhat ties into the previous game)",Excellent! A must for Japanese/noir fans!,1304121600,4,,

I will say that if there was one thing I didn't like, it's very minor ... the on/off switch is 1) hard to see in the dark (for a mouse with led lighting, you think they could light that area up. 2) The switch itself is more like a dial (you rotate it to turn it on/off) and I've found the sliding style easier to use.

As one could guess, Rock Band is best enjoyed as a party game with others, and when the instruments are implemented, they work wonderfully to serve their purpose.  The 58 included songs here, including cuts from Weezer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Jet, and the Ramones among others; are all implemented well, and the in-game screen is flawless as you perform these tunes.  While nearly everything about the PS2 version of Rock Band is spot-on, there are moments where you will notice just how stripped-down this conversion is.  Most notably is the fact that you will not be able to download new content, and an incredibly stripped-down Band World Tour mode is what really hurts the PS2 version of Rock Band, but this was expected to begin with, which doesn't make these lackings a surprise.  What is surprising is how spot-on spectacular the PS2 version of Rock Band ends up being, as there are still a variety of options to explore and modes to play, whether it be alone or as a party game as intended.

5.0,False,"06 7, 2002",A3ASO9OD8GXZO1,B00005KBRD,Michael Fehlauer,"Dungeon Siege is fun. Very fun. The music and atmosphere are not nearly as good as D2, the items are not nearly as cool, and the character development is not as deep, but actual gameplay is richer and more fun.
Meaning, you have multiple characters. Each character has 4 basic item/action slots: melee, ranged, combat magic, nature magic. Switching between these slots is as fast and simple as clicking a button, so you can quickly react to the changing battlefield. Formations and AI for your characters are very easy to set. If things get too hectic (and the smart monster AI makes for hectic battles), you can pause the game to issue orders, swap out gear, plan, or drink potions.
Speaking of drinking potions, the interface is not just user-friendly. It's user-obsessive. Characters only drink as much potion (Health or Mana) as they need. Clicking a single button will order your characters to pick up all the battlefield loot (no more hunting around, clicking on each and every individual pile of gold or piece of treasure). Magic Items are identified right from the start. Archers have unlimited arrows. If you run out of room in your inventory, you can hire a pack mule to carry your stuff. If that runs out of room, you can cast a simple spell and convert your excess inventory into gold. The tab key brings up a megamap of your surroundings, and you can navigate and play the game on the megamap if you wish. You can zoom in, pan, and alter the angle of the camera on the fly, depending on the situation. Once you click on a foe, your characters will attack that foe until it's dead or you give other orders; usually, you just move your party forward and your party members' individual AI will engage the enemy according to your settings (melee guy runs up to engage, but not too far; mages and archers attack from range). Dungeon Siege is not a click-fest.
And it's really fun.",Advances the genre; all other RPGs will learn from DS.,1023408000,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

5.0,False,"09 28, 2011",A23XABNYXBZ08B,B0045ZIENQ,Adol A.,"I read reviews of this game, watched some gameplay, and I decided I had to get it. Definitely worth the 30 bucks, especially when you're getting plenty of gameplay and entertainment out of it. You save a lot of money too due to the DLCs. I'd say about $70-90 considering today's price of the Awakening add-on.

Pros
+Several different classes, traits, and skills.
+Plenty of quests.
+Able to control and play many different party members.
+Ability to change difficulty as you go through the game.
+Able to dual wield. (in my opinion dual wielding is probably the coolest way to fight)
+TONS of content (I've played about 33 hours on easy difficulty and I think I'm only 3/4 through origins, didn't even start awakening)
+Humorous/several dialogue. (They really put effort into making the characters different and have personality)
+No glitches. (at least any noticeable/major ones)
+Party members like or dislike you based on your actions to people.
+(For achievement/gamerscore fanatics) All achievements are offline!

Cons
-Some questlines can be difficult to follow.
-Steep learning curve. (Took me awhile to figure out the shortcut wheel and the tactics system)
-The difficulty is a little too extreme on normal, and a bit too easy on easy. (Yes I know easy's supposed to be easy, but they make it so you lose nearly no damage, and on normal you can die pretty easily unless you plan out the tactics right)

5.0,False,"03 17, 2006",A304YAM2CCDXNN,B0001OK7VW,AndyAuthor,"I rented this game once with a friend without even knowing what it was, and was surprised that we kept going back to rent it every time we were together until I finally got it for Christmas, a week or two later. This game is awesome (or at least to me it is)! I didn't expect it to be as good as it was when I took it off the shelf. It has great, fast paced gameplay, an engaging storyline with lots of secrets (though some people don't like the storyline), and amusing, believable characters! As mentioned, some people don't like the storyline in Tales of Symphonia, this is mainly because it has some cheesy moments... Personally, I just found these moments and lines amusing. The storyline does have lots of emotion and depth though, and I was always kept on the edge of my seat because of all the hidden secrets. The story does of one issue though - pacing. The story moves very slowly, and it takes forever before anything is revealed. In the beginning the plot seems pretty typical, Collete the Chosen has to awaken all the elemental seals in the land of Sylvarant to bring regeneration to the world. But as you progress it gets a lot more complicated than that (you are only going after the seals for about a little less than half the game)! And you realize that nothing is as it seems. The characters are great, they are a little more like ""normal"" people than most RPG heroes, and they all have flaws and good points. There are 9 playable characters in this game (though ultimately you can only have 8 in your party, your group depends on story events), I will now introduce them, be aware that there's some MILD SPOILERS, but I tried to introduce them with the least amount of spoilers possible. Lloyd is the main protagonist - he accompanies Collete on her journey of regeneration, and is also trying to avenge his mother's death and the terrible accident he is partially responsible for in his home town of Iselia. He isn't particularly bright, and can be a little rash, but always tries to do the right thing. Genis is one of Lloyd's best friends, also from Iselia. He is a whiz kid, and an elven magic user. He's a little head strong. Collete is the Chosen, who must release the seals. She is clumsy, gentle, and well, immature, but has a strong sense of responsibility and is very caring. There is also Kratos, who is a mysterious mercenary hired to protect Collete - but it seems he made be hiding something (or lots of things...). Raine's the elven school teacher in Iselia, and Genis' older sister. She has an interest in archeology, and is good at healing magic. Sheena is an assassin hired to kill Collete the Chosen, though her motives for this are unknown at the beginning. Sheena truly cares about people, but takes guff from no one! She is also trained in the art of Summoning. Zelos is cocky and flirtatious (putting it lightly...), but there might be more to him than that... He is a Chosen, like Collete. Presea has a lack of emotion because of an experiment conducted on her. She struggles to find herself again. Regal is kinda the odd one out (he's my least favorite character, anyway), he is a convict that is surprising aristocratic for being one, can't say much else without spoilers. The gameplay has basic RPG elements (talking to people, navigating world maps, solving puzzles in dungeons, etc.), with a fun real-time battle system. The battles always feel crisp, and you can play as any one of the characters I just mentioned. You can pick 3 others to accompany you into battle. You can attack normally, do powerful techs and magic, and unison attacks. You can also set strategies for the computer controlled character in battle to follow, or order them to do certain techs. Some characters are good at melee fighting, some are healers (Raine mainly), and some are mages (Genis mainly). Up to four players can take control of the characters in battle, so your friends can fight along with you! You gain experience, gald, and grade (or lose grade) when you complete a battle. Gald is the currency, and you can also buy certain things with grade (including cool bonuses if you play the game a second time), and you level up with exp. The game also has a title system (where you unlock and chose ""titles"" to change certain stats, sometimes costumes change too), and a cooking system (used for healing). And also has the element of ""affection"", where you answer questions as Lloyd to either get your fellow party members to like or dislike you - this slightly effects the story. The game is challenging without being overly frustrating (though if you really spend time leveling up it becomes pretty easy, and the final boss is disappointing). It also has tons of fun side-quests to do BEFORE beating the game (one annoying thing is after you beat the game you must restart, do all side-quests first!). Whew! This is probably my longest review ever... Well, time for a pros and cons summary:

PROS:

Fun and frantic battle system

Likable characters with lots of personality

Plot has lots of secrets

About right amount of challenge throughout most of the game

Lots of side-quests, and you can buy bonuses 2nd time round

Multiple paths through the story

Good multi-player in battles

CONS:

Plot has bad pacing

Has some cheesy moments

Can be a little hard to figure where to go next sometimes

Final boss is WAY to easy

Don't have a chance to do side-quests after finishing, before restarting

OVERALL: I love this game - personally it's one of my very favorites! It may not be for everybody, but I think a lot of people would really like it.

I have to say that is a pretty hard game.  I have made it through on easy, normal, and hard, but I still have trouble with the palantirs of Sauron and Saruman without cheats.  While it can be extremely frustrating to finish the game; the pure fun comes from re-playing all those levels with different characters and building your characters up to the highest experience level (which is 20).  When you're that high, you can just plow through anybody on any level.  I very much enjoy the levels of Minas Tirith (Top of the Wall and The Courtyard) just because they are incredibly crazy with non-stop action.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"The original Castlevania was a blast, the sequel was a mediocre mess, the third was an epic return to form, but what does this fourth game in the series have to offer? Well, let's just say it combines the awesomism of both Castlevanias 1 & 3! And since the Super Nintendo is one heck of a gaming machine, you can guess how this turns out.

The classic whipping platforming action remains unharmed in this installment. In fact, it is massively improved! Along with the signature items (Cross, tomahawk, dagger, etc), you can now whip in multiple directions! Heck, you can whip it in literally ANY direction possible! Up, down, diagonal, and you can even wiggle it!

Naturally, one would think that it would make the overall experience a cakewalk then, right? WRONG! The geniuses at Konami still managed to keep the difficulty leaning over to the hard side. There are still all kinds of enemies, each with their own unique patterns. The level design is magnificent like always (You know...With the exception of the 2nd game), and keeps things rather interesting. There will even be an area or two utilizing the Super NES's Mode 7 (fake 3D) visuals for backgrounds, as well as Dracula's castle rotating as you try to avoid falling into spike pits!

5.0,False,"02 15, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000FRV2UK,Lisa Shea,"A direct sequel to ""The Wind Waker"" (a rarity for the Zelda series), Phantom Hourglass details the further adventures of Link in the flooded world of Hyrule.

Following an introductory slideshow recapping the events of Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass' story begins with Tetra - or Princess Zelda - being abducted by a ghost ship and Link being set adrift. He wakes up on an island after found by the inhabitants, and immediately sets out to find the phantom ship and save Tetra. The story has some memorable new characters in it, such as the fairy Ciela (who serves mainly as your cursor) and the cowardly but boastful ship's captain, Linebeck.

The gameplay on this system is dependent entirely on the touch screen and, occasionally, the microphone. The directional pad and buttons have no effect whatsoever; everything from running (tap or hold where you want to go) to fighting (slash the stylus in the direction you want to go) to using items is done with the stylus. This undoes one of the main problems of the stylus in other games, namely switching from using buttons to using the touch screen. The microphone also comes into play at some points - either by blowing on it to put out a candle or by yelling into it to call out to someone on the other side of a door.

Like Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass involves sea exploration, but since the new ship in this is a paddle ship (as opposed to the sailing ship from Wind Waker) all that is required is to draw a line on your sea chart to your destination. Speaking of maps, it is possible to write down notes on your map (normally relegated to the top screen, but can be ""pulled"" down to the touch screen); this is necessary in some points to get through areas by copying down safe routes through a trap-laden area or to mark where a particular treasure is. The options are diverse but simple, and an average player should be able to get the hang of the system pretty quickly. The only problem I had with control was that rolling (by making small circles on the edge of your screen) was difficult and got confused with regular movement.

The graphics are a pretty good rendering of Wind Waker's graphical style, with only a slight decrease in smoothness to accommodate the DS's graphical limitations. The cel-shaded style remains intact and it is a pretty good job overall. The sound is about the same as it was in Wind Waker, with limited voice acting (Link's cries, specifically).

As a whole, this game is a good sequel to Wind Waker. I admit that I was wary of the stylus' potential after playing previous DS games with clunkier interfaces, but the gameplay is both smooth and innovative. As a whole, it's a remarkably good product.

Most MMOs are default F1-F8 for your party members and 1-0 for spells/attacks. There are no profiles for most MMOs short WOW, and EQ. Final Fantasy XIV you have to set up macros however it is not hard to do within the game and you can set the keys to send /commands <%> that can use spells/skills, to target, to switch targets, classes/jobs, and send /party messages /FC messaged or /command text.

In addition, you can set 3 colors for M1-M3 so you know what mode/macro set you are in. Like using RED for Raids/quest/attacking mode Green for helping/assisting and blue for socializing or whatever else. There is no LCD SCREEN applet for Final Fantasy XIV so what you can set up in there is random things like a Clock/timer/countdown. You can use the built in applets just for aesthetics like CPU/RAM usage in addition to clock features or even have a NEWS ticker going on.

I bought this WHEN it was the daily special... I got lucky and saw it when it was $57.25. 52% off which even the Logitech rep who  helped me understand more about this keyboard said was a excellent deal.

It is even worth it at the current price it is at as of this review $76.49-80.00 depending on the merchant. $76.49 is the cheapest with PRIME shipping.

Its retail is $119.95 so it is worth it to buy at this time.

5.0,True,"07 29, 2015",A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00DVPMVIU,P. Romance,"Im in total despair.  Why?  I cant believe I missed this awesome game for so long!  I recently just got my very own PS Vita and was looking for new games to buy.  And I kept bypassing this game because of the title and the cover.  I assume it was a rhythm game and I definitely was wrong.

DanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a mystery visual novel, where each chapter ends with a trial.  Think of Ace Attorney meets Hunger Games.  The plot is awesome and I just couldn't put the Vita down.  It was always one more minute.  The game takes place in a dystopian world, where The Tragedy destroy society as we know it.  Where rioting and despair rules.  But there is one place in the world that houses Hope for the future  Hope Peaks Academy.  However, what the school didn't realize that the enemy was already inside, turning their shelter into a killing game.  Now, you and 14 other students must survive the game.  The plot is slowly revealed between 6 chapters.  Each chapter lasts about 5-6 hours.  Each chapter revolves around 1 case.  The main plot is not revealed until the very end, so you don't really know the whole truth throughout the game.  So, the game keeps you interested because you become so invested in the characters well-being and figuring out their stories.

Now come to the puzzle and fun part.  The trials are the real time stealers here.  I have not officially checked the time since I get too engrossed to notice, but the trial themselves takes about 2-3 hours to complete.  I like to note I played the game in Kind mode.  So, it was not as harsh as mean mode.  I found that the trial was not as difficult to figure out as long as you pay attention to the details and figure out the contradiction in the other students argument.  For me, I found Ace Attorney trials to be a little bit harder than this game.  In regards to the logic, I mean.  Its a little more obvious in DanganRonpa.  So, I didn't have too much difficulty getting through the trials.  I messed up a few times but that was due to the rhythm portion.  In any case, if you make a mistake, you can always redo it.  The only thing it affects is your final grade, but its not a huge deal.  The arguments are timed so you cant spend time thinking it over.  Luckily, you can pretty much save at any time except during the prologue.

The graphics are gorgeous and fit the visual novel idea perfectly.  Just imagine flat 2D story book characters against a 3D background.  Like a pop-up book.  I know Im explaining it badly but the visuals are awesome.  As an artist, I love the unique design for each character and it matches their personalities.  The backgrounds are clear and detailed.

For the technical, here is a quick summary.  There is no lag.  Transition from room to room is pretty seamless.  Navigation was easy to use.  I only used the English dialogue, so I cant comment on the Japanese.  But I usually find the Japanese voice acting to be awesome in any game.  Anyway, the English voice acting was good and definitely matches well with each character.  There is English subtitles.  It's not fully voiced throughout.  The trial and cut scenes are completely voiced.  At other times, it will be a quick comment from whoever is speaking.  I cant comment on translation from the Japanese either.  Sorry.  There are some extras at the end, but I haven't a chance to explore it yet.

GET THIS GAME!  If you like visual novels with puzzle elements, this is for you.  And if you are an Ace Attorney fan, get it.  However, if you are not reader, then pass this one by.  I will like to note there are gruesome murder scenes and foul language for those buying for the children.  I have no regrets with this purchase.  I have already started DangaRonpa 2 and I will eventually go back to get all the bonuses for this game later.  But right now, I got my entertainment worth.  This is an awesome game.",Im in total despair.  Why?,1438128000,,,

The graphics are incredible!  As buildings crumble, pillars become a bit misaligned, windows pop out of their frames, and debris crumbles in all directions.  This is old school graphics.  The animation stays crisp and cartoonishly awesome even in a blurry bitmapped polygon world.

Smashing buildings.  Kicking tanks.  Flinging helicopters from the sky.  Eating policemen.  Expect kids 6 to 12 to go Lord of the Flies for days.

Gameplay is simple if not a bit monotonous.  Two player mode is available.  There is a bit of frustration with the y and z dimensions.  To kick a tank, for example, you have to be aligned just right on the street.  This can be forgiven as a challenge of the game.

Pros(there were so many I had to put it on a list):

1. You have 11 people to marry.

2. You can play as boy or girl.

3. Very chibi and cute graphics.

4. Its pretty easier marrying a person since in Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life you had to look into girls diaries which were pretty hard to reach.

5. The town is twice as big than other Harvest Moon games.

6. More exploration.

7. Easier to get money.

8. More crops then usual.

9. Fun.

Pros:

1. The town is a little too big(my sister said that you might get lost easiely)

2. Lack of cutscenes.

3. Controlls are pretty tricky.

4. Getting the Blue Feather is hard.

5. Jamie is really mean. If you marry him/her, the game will be over.

5.0,False,"09 1, 2008",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B000R0SS3Y,R. Pickman,"This game has been getting fairly horrible reviews. The problem is not THIS game, the problem is all the other games. See, we're so used to a game holding our hands through every little facet it has to offer us that when a game comes along and gives you little more than a few tips and a control scheme we think it's just thrown together. When you approach your first troll fight the game doesn't pause and provide a detailed tool tip on how to defeat a troll, YOU have to figure it out. The same goes with most things in the game. It's a game requiring alot of trial and error. You know what though? Figuring everything out is a hell of a lot more rewarding than having everything explained.

At first Too Human comes off as a button mashing loot fest. It can be very frustrating getting through the first few hours. On the surface it seems like the enemies are a bit overpowered and SK used the Valkyrie mechanic to avoid having to balance the game. Once you realize that you're not dying because the game is unbalanced, you're dying because you suck at the game, it gets a lot better. This is a game about strategy, each situation calls for more tactic than power sliding into the fray and mashing around the right control stick. It also requires careful planning of your skill point trees to compliment your play style.

Some people claim the game is too short. This is a game where you CAN sprint through it in around 8 hours and have a character around lvl 18. ?However, my first run through I logged 14 hours and had a level 30 character. Exploring the game isn't necessarily encouraged, but it is most definitely rewarded. I faced enough extra mobs by taking time exploring and trying to get the most out of the game to achieve an extra 12 levels over those who just rushed through it.

The story comes under fire a lot as well. First off, if you don't know anything about norse mythology then the story isn't really going to shine. I think it's funny that people are talking about how stupid or corny the story is when it's all actual Norse mythology that's altered slightly to fit into the sci fi world. To say that the story's stupid, is saying that the Norse myths are stupid, so you can't really blame SK for that. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was pretty fleshed out, it does take a little bit of walking off the beaten path and talking to the other Aesir even when not prompted to. Before you play the game (or even after if you're not happy with the story) go ahead and Wiki Baldur and Fenrir and some other figures and stories from Norse myths. You'll probably appreciate it a lot more. I thought the ending was great and really set up the rest of the series.

There are some problems with the camera angles as most have stated, but I really only had issues a couple times once I got used to it and trusted it to show me what I needed to see. What game doesn't have camera issues though? Another issue I had was with the auto target on the guns. It's really tough for you to pick out a specific target. It's not a huge deal, usually targeting anything that moves is fine, but there were a few instances where I wanted to pick off a certain mob to weaken the group and had difficulty.

Summation: This is a great game and it's really too bad that a lot of people are going to pass it up due to reviews. It takes a few hours to get used to it and figure everything out, but when you do the game really shines. It clocks in at about 8 to 12 hours depending on how much exploring you do, 10 hours seems to be the norm for most games these days. The story is great, but may get lost if you don't do a little research first. Strong replayability. I'm still working on my Defender class. There's a lot to go back and unlock. If your friend has a copy you can do co-op over live for hours of goblin bashing, loot grabbing goodness.

But the allure of the highly touted Killzone, Resistance, Uncharted, God of War, and Metal Gear Solid 4 games finally won me over and I picked up this Killzone 3 bundle. And I think I'm in love. The bundle comes with a 160 gb PS3 slim, ps3 dualshock 3 controller with sixaxis capabilities, av component cable (just the standard red, white, yellow), the power cable, a usb-type cable for connecting the controller to the console for charging it, and a full copy of Killzone 3. No HDMI cable is included. Basic setup is very, VERY easy. Connecting the system to a surround sound system was a little more involved, but still very easy. I have a small surround sound system, where the receiver doubles as a dvd player. There aren't very many input/output options. Fortunately, the PS3 has a handy-dandy function that you'll find under ""sound"" under the ""settings"" option on the main screen that allows you to select a dual audio output (this isn't the technical term) option. It works like this: I connect an HDMI cable from the console to the TV. Then I connected the av component cable(just the red and white) from the console to the surround sound receiver. Make sure the PS3 is set to the dual audio output option and, ""VOILA!"", you've got sound coming out of the TV as well as the surround sound system. Just turn the tv volume to ""0"" and you'll just get beautiful surround sound. If I want to connect my xbox 360 to the receiver, I just unplug the red and white ps3 component cable and plug the xbox cables in. It's a little inconvenient, but it's the price you pay for having a small, simple surround sound system.
  Now as for the PS3 itself, I'm loving it so far. I bought Killzone 2 as well so I could play it before Killzone 3, so I actually haven't even opened killzone 3 yet, but Killzone 2 is absolutely amazing. It's basically Call of Duty/Halo/Gears of War all in one, and it's executed spectacularly. It's so good that even half way through the campaign, I still find myself in awe of how great the graphics, gameplay, and atmosphere are. As a diehard xbox fan (never even owned a PS2), I'd go so far as to say that the killzone games alone *almost* justify buying a PS3. But when you add in the other PS3 exclusives like Resistance, God of War, Uncharted, and Metal Gear Solid 4, and an action game junky like myself is fully justified in owning both the xbox 360 and the PS3.

The open world aspects lets you do so much.  The developer litters the world with tons of side missions, collectables or challenges, and other stuff you really don't have to do, but if you are a completionist you might find yourself trying to complete a number of boring things.  There is so much to do and the game seems so long to me that I quit half way through to play something else for a few months and then returned to continue.  In my opinion they could have split the game into smaller pieces.  But thats what has always been great about GTA, it offers so much value since there is so much to it.  I have to overlook boring and optional aspects that are less fun and focus on how much is great that is far above and beyond what could have been included.

You have ""friends"" and girlfriends in the game that call you on your cell phone.  They bug you all the time to do stuff.  The problem is the stuff they want to do is pretty boring, involves stopping what you are doing and driving to pick them up, doing something boring with them, dropping them off, etc.  It is fun at first, but then seem tedious.  There are advantages to making them happy with you because you get bonuses, but gets pretty boring.  I ended just ignoring them all together towards the end.

The other thing is it takes a long time to get from one side of the world to another.  But there are taxis you can hail and jump to the destination pretty easily.  It just feels like you are missing out or cheating by skipping driving through the open world to get there.

There are tons of reviews, so I don't really need to say more.

Pros:

-Nice cel-shaded graphics(Level 5 surpassed their previous epic Dark Cloud 2's graphics)

-Excellent voice acting

-A Battle system turned based RPG lovers can easily relate to

-A great story

-106 hours!?  Cor Bliemy!  People who love games with lots of hours with things to do are gonna have a ball(Well, it might be shorter for people, I spent like 32 hours finding mini-Medals, looking for monsters, and leveling up.

-When you have trouble it's cool to have you crew tell you stuff you might be able to use

-The monster arena is nice while it lasts

-Side quests can be really helpful(One can give you the abiliy to ride a sabercat, and it's about 4x the walking speed)

-Nice set of fighting characters:

--Hero(Nothing really interesting)

--Yangus(The oversised bandit who can put out a bit of laughs)

--Jessica(well, Va, Va, Voom, is how someone mentioned her as, meaning she's just plain out hot, and she can change costumes)

--Angelo(The pimp, just like Jessicas beauty is needed in RPGs, every RPG needs a ladies man)

-Setting skills and stuff is pretty cool

-Everyone has their own personal skills, I like hero's because Omniheal is freakin' sweet, and Jessica's because he can charm an enemy.

-Phsycing up is very handy on boss fights(Cept fpr the ones who use waves of Ice)

-I love zoom(It helps out with traveling to previous place a whole lot)

-The alchemy pot is nice after grabbing some recipies

-After completing the game you can enter new dungouns with your completed game data(Ah, just like Radiata Stories)

-This game is a must for any RPG fan

Cons:

-I can't stand that the best way to level up to to fight slimey piles of metal, who are hard to penetrate, and most likely rin off during the first turn(The huge ones give away more EXP than 2 bosses would, and I mean near final bosses)

-When you need weapons that cost around over 20,000 gold, and regular enemies offer around 100-200 gold, it can be a mojor drag(Unless you fight gold golems, but they aren't always promised to show up)

-I hate going to a church everytime to save(No more save points in front of bosses, that sucks)

-I hate going back to a previous dungen, and Yangus says there's one piece of treausre left, and it happens to be a map

-The casino sux mad bootie crack!(What casino doesn't have blackjack or poker.  That really blows)

-I wish there was more interaction with the characters(Too much of random other people talking, random fights, and not enough voices from your party talking)

Neutral:

-balancing weapons is cool, but after finding all 110 mini medals and finding out flails of destruction is a good weapon, it makes me a little mad that I didn't upgrade fistcuffs for Yanghus

-If only Red could be a member(She's hot, sexy, bad additude, but she pissed me off on one or 2 ocasions, and fighting isn't her cup of tea.  Sad

-Hero is sort of a blend of Jak from the first Jak and Daxter, and Tidus from Final Fantasy X: He can't talk, and his name isn't mentioned at all througout the game.  A veeeeery intersting guy, don't you think?

Dragon Quest VIII is a good ol' traditonal style RPG that definitly has a story to tell, and places to explore.  It is the first Dragon Quest to make it over to America, and it has gave me and other gamers a great ride to remember: an epic full of wonders and exeitment to journey through as you play it.

Galford has a dog/wolf and Nakoruru has a cormorant/falcon.  Each character has a different reason for why they are seeking the energy orb that Amakusa possesses...some for good, others for evil.  One more special feature is that the computer is a learning computer, even on this version, meaning that if a player continues to use the same attack pattern, the CPU will learn how to counter it, even on easy mode.  Mixing-up attacks and defensive stances will give greater yields of success.  BOTTOM LINE:  This game is fun and is worth playing.  I highly recommend purchasing Samurai Shodown.",Street Fighter---Samurai Style!,1247097600,3,,

This is't your average Mortal Kombat or Tekken game. You don't have limited health, you aren't crammed up in a tiny little space, and the computer player dosen't always win. You can run around on vast terrains, where items such as light sabers (Samus Aron or Star Fox, I don't know), pokeballs (Pokemon), hammers(The original Donkey Kong arcade), and lasers (Star Fox) fall from the sky, and are at whoever grabs them first's disposal. The levels are:Mario Brother's flying island thingie, Zelda's castle, Saffaron City, Star Fox's ship, Samus Aaron's near-destructed planet, Donkey Kong's jungle, Yosie's island, and Kirby's planet. There's also a hidden level, The Mario Brother's classic arcade world. And, now, the players:Mario, Yoshi, Kirby, Star Fox, Samus Aron, Donkey Kong, Link, and...Pikachu. And, there a 4 bonus characters, and I'll tell ya how to get them:
Jigglypuff-All you have to do is beat the game, on any mode, no matter how many lives you lose.
Captain Falcon-Beat the whole game on any challenge level in under 20 minutes.
Ness-Beat the game on normal with only 3 lives, without getting any game overs.
Luigi-Go to pratice and beat everyone's (except the bonus character's) bonus game 1. Luigi is faster and stronger than Mario.

After playing through half of the missions, it didn't disappoint! The two analog sticks makes playing the game like on regular console, although I'm a bit slow to touch the screen to go over the barricade or toggling zoom of the gun's target scope. The graphics are impressive on a small screen. I'm really surprised to see smoke or fog moving in open areas. That's a testament to including advanced software logic, as well as such powerful portable console. The sound is very good. With a very good headset, I can hear solders talking and whispering (softly) on one or the other ear.

There are 36 missions that will get unlocked in sequence when previous mission is completed. Sometimes other missions will get unlocked as well. The maps get re-used for different missions. Personal score is compared to those in the area, region, and global. For each mission I was encouraged to replay, get better, and move on to next level within the mission. It suggests best personnel for each mission, but I'm free to choose the character I want. The length of each mission is short enough where I can, at any time, take out Vita to play a bit. It's a nice alternative to the simple games found on smartphones (iPhone, Android).  So to me it has high replay value on a day-to-day basis.

The online co-op allows me to either join in or create a public/private co-op, but I haven't had a chance to try. Same with high value targets. Will update this review when I spend sufficient time with them.

But I really like the daily challenge. It's truly challenging! So challenging that I find I spend more time playing the daily challenge then playing the missions! As long as I don't leave the challenge, I can keep trying. This adds more frequent play time on the daily basis! I think it's an awesome addition and will keep me interested in playing Unit 13 on daily basis.",High Replay Value,1331164800,10,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation Vita'}",

I heard about the Kirby series while playing Super Smash Bros.  I became skilled with Kirby's character, swallowing Link and Samus and using DK's super punch...then I heard about the Crystal Shards on a commercial and got it.

It is indeed an excellent game.  The story is thus: Kirby gets smacked on the head with a strange crystalline object and is thrust into an adventure with countless baddies, deadly bosses, and cool music.  I particularly enjoyed combining two powers and make a new one.  You could combine spark and freeze and turn Kirby into a refrigerator in order to heal himself with food.  Or you could combine needle with freeze and turn Kirby into a giant expanding snowflake that freezes enemies that come near it.  Pure ownage.

For the most part, this game is short and simple, with the exception of a few levels and bosses: On World 5: Shiver Star, there are two difficult levels.  And as for the bosses, I'd have to say the boss of Neo Star is real cool-looking and hard.

The effects are what really give this game a significant boost in terms of quality; the sound effects are devastating.  When fighting Mag Man, the boss of world 4: Neo Star, it uses a special attack in which lava thrusts your platform into the ceiling; you could hear the magnificent sound effect of searing lava lunging upward, and it really amplified Mag Man's image as a boss character.

Not only are the effects great, but so is the level design!  Each level has great detail, enemy locations, and great twists.  On Shiver Star, there is a level that most closely resembles a mega-mall in the winter time; you can ride escalators, elevators, dodge colorful falling shelves.  Another exciting level would be the underground factory on the same world.  The background art is astounding for this level; you see tanks of frozen organisms that look extremely freakish, there are strange grinning machines that try to crush you, and there are tight spaces with cannons and the ceiling trying to crush you against the floor.  Whoa.

And the music goes along with the situation: in the wintertime mega-mall level, Christmas-type music plays.  In the factory level, mechanical percussion dominates.  In the more pleasant grassy stages, peaceful classic Kirby music plays as you hop along swallowing guys for their powers.

The only fault I found with this game was that I wish it was longer.  If you ever get bored with it, start collecting enemy info cards, playing the multiplayer minigames, listening to the sound tests, and even trying to collect each and every crystal shard and experiment with various abilities.  It is nigh impossible to be bored with this game.

Let me make a comment on the graphics as well: they are great.  These graphics are worthy of a sega dreamcast, they are not the traditional ""blocky"" graphics of several N64 games; they are easily told apart.

That's all the info I need to state that this is easily one of the best N64 games out there.  Being a huge Nintendo fan, i highly recommend you buy this game.

And, to my surprise and delight, this one is. The 'over the ear' headphones alone are up in the league with stand-alone versions in that price range. So, if 'quality and comfort' count well... they come at a price. But let me discuss/rate the package in its entirety.

CONTENTS, INSTALLATION, DOCUMENTATION WARRANTY (4.5 out of 5)

This is what you get out of the box:

* Sound Blaster Tactic Omega Wireless Headset (the headphones)
* Detachable Microphone
* Sound Blaster Recon (module that connects to the PC or gaming console)
* Tactic Link wireless card (plugs into the Recon)
* Installation CD (for PC only)
* Inline volume control (for Xbox only)
* Micro USB-to-USB cable (2 of them, will explain why)
* Optical cable

Setup is clearly illustrated by the Quick Start leaflet. It's as easy as attaching the wireless card to the Recon module and connecting the module to the PC or gaming console. Consoles are also using the optical cable. The Xbox requires that the Inline volume control wire is connected to the wireless controller (I only used it with a PS3 and a PC).

The headphones charge from any PC or standard USB charger (not provided) through the provided USB cable. I used successfully both a PC and a third party PS3 charger. If used with a PC/laptop you should be able to use the second USB cable to charge the headphones while using them if needed. Once charged, the headphones will link to the Recon module within seconds of powerup.

Half a star is lost for the warranty terms. It only lasts for one year and the shipping costs are the owner's responsibility. Make sure that you save the dated purchase receipt to avoid any surprises.

OPERATION AND USER EXPERIENCE (5 stars out of 5)

When used with a console, the Recon module and headphones all controls are good enough to provide a superior gamer (and not only) experience. Besides volume controls on both the module and the headphones, there is Mic Gain switch (low/mid/high) to control voice input. When playing games you can select the 'scout mode' especially on FPS which will enhance the sounds made by your opponents. The other option is THX TruStudio Pro mode, perfect for listening to music or movie watching.

On a PC the options expand dramatically. You don't need to use the provided software on the PC but if you need total control over your THX setup - surround mode from 2 to 7 speakers, bass, crossover frequency - over how you are heard when you speak into the microphone (we're set to 'alien brute'), the dynamic range control plus a mixer and an equalizer that allows you to pick any of a number of preset profiles or make up your own... you will be using the software.

I found the adjustable headphones to be extremely comfortable. Hours of use at a time caused no noticeable discomfort.

RATING (5 stars)

I finally looked into them right b4 swap force released for my little cousin. Mind u, I am no stranger to video games. I own an absurd amt of ps3 games & I love to play. I'm pretty well informed on the ps3 era. I must say, I was instantly fascinated by skylanders toys to life idea. Not only is it genius marketing by a company,  but what a grand idea that taps into kids imagination & provides an interactive world for them to join by taking their skylanders characters,  placing on a portal hooked to their game console & watching them come to life on screen where they control whichever character they place on portal.  Each character has 1 of the 3 elemental powers (water, fire, air) which comes in handy thru out game. Also have their own unique way of battling.

  Idea of swap force is, w/ the swappable characters,  u can swap top of 1 character w/ bottom of other which combines their abilities depending on how u place them. Say 1 guy floats & other walks, put floating guys bottom half on walking guys top. Now walking guy floats, but its deeper than that cuz each character has some benefit to each half of body. It's up to kids to choose how to combine & problem solve w/ their choices. (Jumping, flying, projectile, etc) Possibilities r endless.

  It is a very exciting gift for the kids on your xmas list, bdays etc. Prepare to b the favorite of whomever u gift this to, if in fact they own & enjoy 1 or more of any of these game consoles (ps3,  ps4,  xbox360, xbox1, wii, wiiU, Nintendo 3ds). Games/starter kits must b purchased specifically for the console they own, but if buying just the characters, they are all interchangeable & work on all consoles. Brilliant.  Kids can bring figures (characters) to friend's house & play on their console & all progress saved on actual figure. Yes. Characters have built in memory.  Told u it was brilliant. This helps make up for fact that this is an expensive hobby/series.

  Kids can enjoy the game w/ just the characters included in starter pk, but they will of course b rewarded for having more characters in game & have more access to certain areas. Bcuz it would cost a bundle to buy them all, the fact kids can share characters w/ each other by bringing theirs & letting friends try out theirs & trying out their friends. It can soothe that ""mommy, I need this guy for my game to get into this area"" need/want & also encourage cooperative play w/ friends.

  This is super kid friendly game. Great story, great characters & actors portraying them r just as good as fun characters in animated movies. It's fun, immersive,  interesting,  fascinating, colorful & kids play as the heroes,  the skylanders. While they are combat based characters, this is not your average violent video game catering to adults. This is meant for kids & it's hero based combat where kids r in the shoes of the heroic skylanders out to save their beloved land from villains. So worry not. My aunt never would've allowed me to give my 6 yr old cousin a game that wasn't appropriate for kids & I wouldn't dream of it either. I will say, our gift was the end all & b all for him. He was thrilled & I played w/ him. He was full of excitement & in awe of colorful environments, fun characters, an awesome adventure, cool puzzles , etc.
These games have excellent replay value as each character gives different experience & ways to problem solve. We bought him the earlier game also for his bday (Spyros). He couldn't have been happier.  For xmas he's getting Giants & I'll find trap team eventually for a deal & get that for next gift after xmas. Its a wonderful series. You can look up professional reviews for the games by googling ""IGN video review of skylanders swap force"" (or whichever game) . It'll give u full rundown & show u what game looks like. Pretty impressive. Another great feature is co-op play being & on & off option that won't interfere w/ game if some1 joins or quits playing anytime during game.  Example, u r playing w/ your son/daughter, your character & their character r on portal. U now have to start dinner but don't want to interrupt the game. It doesn't.  Simply removing your character from portal takes u/character out of game & they can continue playing uninterrupted & won't affect progress or anything.  This way no1 waiting around for the other to come back & control their character.  Goes from 1 to 2 player & vice versa seamlessly.  Also great idea.  Hope this helps u! Happy gifting!",Genius!,1414281600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The boss battle style encore for each set is spot on. They expanded everything from the first game, but the expanded track listing leaves something to be desired. Unfortunately just like the annual DDR games there are some tracks that you'll know and enjoy because you like the song and others you won't really recognize or like and generally won't play.

First let me get the negative out of the way. The track listing is really skewed. With the exception of a handful of classic rock songs like Free bird, the music seems limited to 80s & early 90s, and mostly on the 80s side. The most recent song was a mid 90s song by the Foo Fighters. I don't really have a problem with that, but the inclusion of more recent artists like Franz Ferdinand or Incubus in the first game was a plus.
Also the songs by Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, & Alice in Chains among others are possibly the least popular in their back catalog. It seems that Red Octane simply did not want to pay for more popular songs. Do you really think the best Aerosmith song is ""Last Child?"" I bet it is one of the cheaper one to licence. I love the Rolling Stones, but I don't think ""Can't you hear me knockin'"" is even in my top ten. Some of these songs are in the game so the box can have the artist's name on it. The filler songs do stand out. Also the purchasable songs are as blah as it was in the first game, with the exception of Strogbad's ""Trogdor the burninator"" with enhanced guitar solo.

Difficulty applies until you learn best how to defeat your enemies, then it becomes somewhat forthright if not at least doable.  However, you cannot become complacent as this game will quickly kill you off with added penalties (although getting killed is actually a very intriguing if not integral part of the gameplay experience).  Brilliant game mechanics with amazing (yet sometimes subtle) attention to detail.

I put off purchasing this game for a long time, fearing the difficulty level so heavily advertised would be a major turn-off.  Silly decision - I can't think of any game where frustration and difficulty is matched with such a satisfying gameplay experience.

THe immersion is amazing. Open expances of the three massive islands, combined with incredible individual story lines makes this the most memorable and satisfying game I have ever played. No joke there. Ghost Recon got a 5/5 for gameplay mechanics, realism, replay, and the breathtakining visuals. This gets a 5/5 for story, gameplay, variety, immersion, replay, and the most accurate depiction of men at war since, well I cant even think of something to compare to this.
The flaws are very minor, such as being able to kill with an mp5 from any distance, and the occasionalterrain glitch while flying by in an Abrams, but for what you get, you cannot even notice these little errors.
The story is wonderful. No FMV, instead, just live in-game cutscenes move the story along, and boy does it move. As you follow the character's transitions from a green GI ready to go home, a specialist demolitions and recon expert (not sure if they called him a SEAL or not), or a helicopter or plane pilot making dropoffs and search and destroy missions, everyone is unique, and you can see the development they go through as you control them.
I grew attached as playing as Lt. Armstrong, the 'main' character in the game, and by far the most fun to play as. The vehicle and covert missions are quite enjoyable too, but none match the tenseness and heart pounding battles that you will face as Lt. Armstrong.
There are other very fun games out there, and Im not bashing them at all because Ghost Recon or the Rainbow 6 series are a couple of my favorite real-time wargames ever made.

In fairness to the developer, and in recognition of their great work, I wanted to post a review for their other PS3 game, ""Heavenly Sword"", which I loved. This game was a much-needed burst of game goodness when it launched, as there was a severe shortage of quality games available for the PS3 during its first year.

The game still holds up well, even though it's five years old, and it's a lot of fun. Controls are a breeze and empowering, the graphics are fantastic, the story is solid, and the voice acting is superb. I actually prefer this game over ""God of War 3"" (which is also excellent), because it's brighter, not as gloomy, and it doesn't bog down the action with foolish backtracking and puzzles that simply aren't fun. ""Heavenly Sword"" is often likened to ""God of War"", and that's an accurate comparison - but it's actually more fun than the game that inspired it.

The best part of this game is probably the involvement of Andy Serkis (best known as ""Golem"" and ""King Kong""). Just as in the Lord of the Rings movies and the modern King Kong film, Andy Serkis provides outstanding motion capture acting that makes for a truly unique experience in gaming. He also provides some excellent voice acting, as you might suspect! I hope to see him back in another game some day.","The ""Serkis"" comes to town!",1329177600,2,,

Well, that's because this game was built around realism, not just a ""oh you're out of ammo, let me pull some out of my rear end"" type game play.  I love COD, but it's not as realistic as Fallout.

The cable is shorter than a HRAP and a Madcatz TE stick, so I had to purchase an extension cable to sit comfortably from the television.  My futon is around eight feet from the television, so plan accordingly.

Other than the short cord, I have no complaints.  The construction is sturdy and the joystick and buttons are all confirmed Sanwa.  (I opened the panel and all the buttons are quick disconnects and the wiring is done well with no bunches of cables or loose wires.)  The panel is easily accessible much like the TE sticks, with only a hex key needed.

I love the artwork on the panel and have no intentions of changing it.  The stick looks absolutely gorgeous though it is prone to finger prints, but that's certainly not abnormal.

The stick does include a compartment to tuck the cable away, and also two ports for keyboard support and headphone support.  It's also slightly larger than the TE stick.

I'm impressed.  I haven't purchased a HORI stick since the HRAP came out and I'm loving the size and quality of this stick more, especially the Sanwa buttons.  The black casing with the red plunger was a nice choice for this stick.",Soul Stick,1329264000,8,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The Puyo Puyo series has a long and cryptic history here in the States. While a mainstay for the puzzler genre in Japan, Puyo Puyo has been released in many alternate forms, masking its origins over here. Veteran puzzler gamers will recognize the game engine as the same exact one from the Genesis and Game Gear's Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and the SNES's Kirby's Avalanche. Fever shares a lot with many other puzzler games; Puyo blocks drop down from the screen, and players try to combine four in a row to send a nuisance Puyo over to their opponent until their screen fills up---you can also unleash chain combos for devastating effects. But the new Fever mode adds a definite frantic dimension to the game. During a match, you build up your Fever gauge by eliminating Puyos, and when it's full, you'll enter Fever mode, which gives you a screen full of triple Puyo sets---one well-placed Puyo can set off a unstoppable chain saving you from the brink of disaster or unleashing a fatal blow to your opponent. The only limitation Fever has is that it supports only two players.

Additional enhancements in Fever included larger quadruple Puyo clusters, a 16-character lineup (two of which are unlockable), four courses, Free Battle mode in single player, three default rule settings, the ability to edit rules for versus mode, and three Endless Puyo Pop ""classic"" games. While single-player and Endless Puyo Pop modes are engaging, they can only really be considered training for the Versus mode. When you play against an actual person, the gameplay becomes faster paced and furious. Players must learn to adapt and process enormous amounts of information in a split second, paying attention to their current Puyo pile, the next Puyo piece, their Fever gauge, and their nuisance Puyo bank on the top of the screen. If you don't have any triple Puyo sets on your screen, the nuisance Puyo bank will unleash its contents. This will screw up your screen, and you'll hear the annoying chants of your opponent's character as he buries you. The characters are all well balanced and have varying styles and strategies, and they seem to be well designed to annoy the heck out of you while you play. There's nothing like the feeling of doom as you're fixated on your screen while you here the chants of the opposing character making chain after chain combos. With single, versus, and three endless modes, and 16 available characters, Fever is as addictive as it gets.",Just as I remember it....,1103932800,4,,

For one, the game is one of the most entertaining arcade style driving games I have played since Burnout Paradise. The thing is, this game is kind of a mix between Burnout Paradise and the first 2 PS1 Driver titles. You have the story, and the different missions that you need to do (such as follow, reach the point, getting chased, and needing to wreck the opposing driver, and so on), only with a Burnout Paradise sort of style. The environment (a re-imagined sort of remake of San Francisco and some parts of neighboring Counties) is open world. While it may not be an accurate recreation of San Francisco, it is accurate enough to be familiar, and a blast to drive through. Scattered throughout the streets, are various races, and stunts that you can accept and perform for bonus cash credit. Now this cash credit is used to purchase everything from more cars (to use for various races and stunts, as well as your garage storage) to extra abilities. While you way need lots of cash credit in order to purchase things throughout the game, it is nice to know that it is very easy to earn, as you are paid for doing just about any kind of aggressive maneuver in this game.

Now, the physics may not be completely realistic, which is a slight disappointment for hardcore Driver fans, the good is the fact that the physics work alongside the arcade style direction that this game decided to head in. This game is all about entertainment, and is succeeds at this admirably. Once you start to understand the game, and once you begin to understand exactly why things are the way they are, everything just seems to work, and work well. Sure, it may have a few rough spots from time to time, but honestly, you will be having such a blast playing this game that you probably won't care. The inclusion of real cars is fantastic, as you start to get a feel for how each and every car performs differently. Plus, they all sound different and distinctive, which is all great for car enthusiasts. Basically, I consider this one of those rare games, that might not win you over with movie like story presentation, and might not win you over with ""game of the year"" material, but it succeeds so well at entertaining you, and with that, you can't help but to respect it for the fact that it accomplishes exactly what all video games should do, that we all too often forget: simply being fun to play. In a time when video games seem to be trying their hardest to become films, we have a game that goes back to the roots of what made gaming fun in the first place.","Didn't like the demo, had a blast playing the full version",1316822400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Since theres a timer built into this game saying how long you've played it, I realized I have played it for a total of 93 hours. And even with that much time played, I still have plenty to unlock, but I'll tell you what I have unlocked, so many characters, modes, levels, and what I still have to finish, the history-filled trophies you collect so many of. I'm currently at 276 trophies, and theres a total of 291 in the game. But enough of that, the thing that stood out the most to me was the event mode. Most of these tasks seemed impossible at first, but when you figure out the perfect strategy for each event, the difficulty eases slightly and its not as impossible.

Graphics: 9
The characters are extremely fine tuned. No more of the papery type looks of the original N64 version. Graphics are perfect for this game's cartoony type feel. I cant really complain about this game's graphics, but the backgrounds of the levels could better.
Gameplay: 10
This game takes so much time to really master it due to the difficulty of the Computer's AI. In the N64 version, I didn't even own it and I beat the game on very hard difficulty with no problem. While many people get annoyed at the computer's abilities at harder difficulties, I find it as more of a challenge and it makes me want to play the game more. But, sometimes I believe the computer doesnt want me to accomplish certain tasks when I spend around 10 minutes working on all-star mode, only to die on the very last level when I fall on a bomb. Another thing I liked about this game was the amazingly fast gameplay. This game runs so fast during battle that you constantly lose track of where you are on each level. The gameplay can't be beat though, I say.
Modes: 9
The problems that the N64 version of this game had, this game made up for entirely, with 17 multiplayer modes, several one-player modes that AREN'T boring, and various other things in the game. The only reason i gave this section a 9 instead of a 10, is because of the seemingly unending adventure mode.
Value: 10
If you aren't satisfied with this game, you need to have brain surgery, QUICK!! As I said before, I've played this game for a total of 93 hours, and I still haven't gotten bored of it.

I read the negative reviews and decided to give it a try anyways.  To be honest, if you don't have access to Live Gold, then DO NOT buy this game.  While you can play the game without it, you literally can only do the ""Situations.""  Which I believe were only ten situations of the game that basically introduce you to the characters, maps, and weapons.  It takes no time to go through them and you will be bored in no time.

Yes, the game has NO single player campaign.  And while I do believe they shouldn't release a game as limited in gameplay as this for $60, the multiplayer and terrorist hunt game modes just about make up for it.  However, a campaign similar to Vegas 2 would have been awesome.  The multiplayer mode is a lot of fun.  You can work closely with your team or try to do things yourself.  It is 5 on 5 and you are either on the attack or defending.  Each of those scenarios carries a different set of unlockable characters and weapons.  If you are attacking, you start the round with a remote controlled drone that you use to infiltrate the building and find the enemy team, hostage, or bomb.  If you are defending, you start the round trying to fortify the room you have been given to keep the hostage or bomb safe from enemy forces.

The gameplay is very nice.  Graphics are great, weapons look, sound, and operate very realistically. It is a very fresh take on first person shooter games.  I always hated the Call of Duty games because they are so stupid when you stop and think about it.  People just running around shooting with no real consequences of dying.  In Siege, when you die, you have to wait until the round is over to play again.  While you wait, you can watch security cameras and other players on your team and help them defeat enemies via talking through the microphone.  This game forces you to at times, be a ""Camper""-the type of person that is shunned from COD games.  I personally much prefer this to COD or Battlefield.

Biggest Gripes - The load times are maybe a touch on the long side and once in a while I get disconnected from their servers but the game just came out and I am sure that will improve.  There aren't too many options for weapons and are limited to what character you choose to play as for each round.  But overall, I think this is a solid game and doesn't deserve the low ratings it's getting at the time of release.  If you wanted a single player campaign, then go buy a different game.

This game has the greatest story line and character development I've ever seen.  It's like a first person shooter with a small RPG element (I never play RPG's but this one has a very simple and fun system).  Spectacular aiming.  Spectacular game progression.

The graphics for the characters are amazing.. as for the maps they are medium but I think thats to make sure the aiming is perfect.

Oh and by the way this game is 20-40 hour single player.  If you're a great gamer I would still stick to 4/5 difficulty for your first 2 play throughs.

Greatest value ever at this price. Greatest game ever.  I won't spoil too much.

I use a dual core 2.9 with GTX 460 768mb video card.  This game probably requires a bit less.

Its a very simple system where you will usually get 3 options to respond with; a paragon(charming) answer, a neutral answer, or a renegade (tough guy) answer.

Anyway, this game is simply good addictive fun that ends up taking over your life, lol. Soccer played in rocket powered cars/vans. Laughably simple idea executed to perfection. It features offline seasons and exhibitions so you can play by yourself against bots (not sure if there is local co-op or not) as well as a full tutorial broken down into sections to teach the basic mechanics of the game. However, online matches are definitely the way to go. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 (ranked matches don't include the 4v4 chaos though). You have basic mathces and ranked matches. Ranked matches are a little more tricky because when somebody quits (and somebody always ends up quitting at some point), the match doesnt autopopulate with anybody queued to play or with bots, so your teams can end up unbalanced. Of course, the flip side of this is that when you win a 1 or 2 on 3 match, it is especially sweet! Speaking of autopopulating, that's what happens in non ranked matches as people quit. It just fills the void, either with another player or, if another player isn't available for whatever reason, it fills the blanks with bots.

So, thems the basics. There is turbo boost, acquired by running over little turbo buffs located at specific spots in the arena (they are always at the same spots, and reset after like 15 seconds), which fills your counter part way (except for 6 100% boost buffs located on the axis points). You can use the boost to literally fly, drive on the walls, and for a little while, even on the ceiling, giving this game a 360 degree 3D aspect to it. Anything can potentially happen at anytime, and the matches are often chaotic as can be. That said, when a team gels, it is something to behold. Which leads me to another aspect.....team building. Via invites, you can make sure that you and up to 3 of your friends can play on the same teams for every match, giving you the ability to develop in game strategies, made even easier if everybody uses headsets.

Anyway, that is a quick summation of this game. Once you play, you will likely want to keep on playing for a while. It is just some of the best fun to be had out there.",Will boost straight to the top (of your heart).,1439078400,,,

Lego Star Wars was great, Lego Indy was inferior but still fun, and this one shows the natural progression in the series.  It capitalizes on everything that was good about the first game, continues the gameplay improvements they made in Indy, and maximizes the potential of so many characters in the Batman universe.

Perhaps I'm biased, as I admit to being a Bat-fanatic, but is definitely the most fun to play.  The only (slight) problem is with all the special suits for Batman and Robin, there are almost too many characters to flip through on free play.

The trailers excitedly announced that you can play as either heroes or villains, which I interpreted just to mean that you could switch characters in free play, same as always.  But it turned out to mean that there are separate sets of levels, so that your mission is either to pull off a heist, or stop the same heist.  This means there are a total of 30 levels, way more than any previous Lego game (except The Complete Saga, which bundled SW part I & II together).  You'll be glad you have more levels to play, because they're awesome!

Oh, and if you're wondering whether they use the plots of the old Batman movies or the new movies, the answer is neither.  The plot lines of the chapters are not related to any Batman movie, but it seems like each chapter features the main characters and ""feel"" of a different movie.  Chapter 1 features Poison Ivy, Freeze, Bane, Two-Face, etc. and seems to be an homage to Batman Forever.  In Chapter 2 you'll battle Catwoman, Penguin, and some others, and is clearly meant to give the feel of Batman Returns.  Chapter 3 features the Joker and Scarecrow and seems to be a mix of Batman & Dark Knight.  There are a number of lesser villains used who were never in any of the movies, which is a nice touch for Bat-geeks who've ever been into the comics.

This game has a few small bugs but just like all the other games that are made for console then reprogrammed for PC, an update will eventually and will hopefully fix most of the problems.
Even with the PC loading slow, and the gaming having to start a level over every time you change a video setting, this game is still fun to play and action packed.
The campaign is like watching a movie, I almost want to get a tub of popcorn every time I load it up. The story is simple and moves fast and the gun play is right back to where it should be. Ghost on PC had sooo many problems and got worse and worse with every update. This new game with its flaws is still great.

5.0,False,"01 11, 2001",A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM,B00004R8V4,SnowedUnder,"This game is incredibly simple yet dangerously addictive... Basically it is a game of cat and mouse; you have a rocket positioned on the game field and you have to lead 'chu chu's (mice) to your rocket by placing arrows for them to follow. If you (or your opponents) lead a 'kapu kapu' (cat) into your rocket, you lose a third of all the mice you have collected so far. Whoever has the most mice after three minutes wins. Throw in the fact that some mice trigger special events (mouse mania, cat mania, speed up, etc.) and also that you can only place three directional arrows at a time and you have a fantastic, fast-paced puzzle/party game that should be in any self-respecting Dreamcast owner's selection. The best moments in this game are those panic-stricken moments when you have 10 seconds left and you're losing by 100 mice. Can you lead that cat to the winning rocket in time and take the lead? Only one way to find out...
While the game has brilliant puzzle and challege modes that will keep you occupied for a while, the brilliance of the game lies in it's multiplayer modes. Play with up to four players (two teams of two or four single players) on one Dreamcast for ultimate party fun (and black eyes, if it gets out of hand, and it usually does!) or, if you can't persuade your friends to join you, play with three other people online. The online play is excellent. Lag is definitely a factor, but you just have to get used to the fact that there is a delay and treat it as a challenge to think ahead. The online menu interface is very simple to use, and it is easy to find and play your friends up in North Dakota or out in Oklahoma. The server lets Japanese and American players play simultaneously, and surprisingly the lag is no different to when all players are local. Sadly, there is now a slew of other online games, which means interest in Chu Chu Rocket (a pioneer in Dreamcast online gaming) is waning. There are a loyal group of followers who play online, however, and it isn't too difficult to get a game or two, especially in the evening when the server is at its busiest. During the day the chances of finding someone to play a game is remote, although if you hang around for a few minutes you can usually bump into a lost soul from Tokyo who's willing to take you on. There is a ranking table for online players, but you'll have to win over 6000 games if you want to take the #1 spot!
You can still enjoy the multiplayer mode on your own using the computer AI, which is generally very intelligent. You can set the level of difficulty to suit your skill level.
The puzzle mode should not be overlooked, as it has some very interesting (and frustrating!) puzzles to complete. And if the many puzzles aren't enough for you (I'm at #79 and still going!) then you can make your own. If you think they're good enough you can upload them onto the Internet for other players to dowload and try, and of course you can download other people's puzzles.
There is also a 'stage challenge' mode where you have to finish 24 challenges as fast as possible. This is much easier if you persuade a friend to help you. You can upload your times onto the Internet to see how you rank in the world, but don't expect to see your name near the top unless you're prepared to spend a lot of time perfecting each challenge.
The graphics of the game are quite sufficient. They're simplistic and colorful; they are in full 3D, too. Although they aren't exactly pushing the Dreamcast to its limits, they are perfect for the game. One bonus is that the game only uses 3 blocks of your VMU memory card space, so you can use those precious 197 remaining blocks to save those VMU-hungry games in your collection.
This game is well worth the money if puzzle/multiplayer games are your thing. If you hate all puzzle games then don't bother, but if you are looking for a departure from your usual Dreamcast gaming then you will undoubtedly find this an enjoyable game to own. It simply oozes fun all over, something many newer games lack. Go for it, you won't be disappointed as long as you don't expect an earth-shattering gaming experience. If you want a simple, frenetic game to pop into your Dreamcast every now and then and relieve stress, this is a must-have.",Wonderfully addictive puzzle game! A classic.,979171200,5,,

5.0,False,"08 28, 2017",A2VWPJGE6YSGAN,B000VG6Z9S,Kurgan,"If you're like me, you remember a simpler time when Professional Wrestling was ""cool"" and wrestling video games were all the rage. But let's be honest, while many of these games had big colorful characters and some fun commentary voice acting, most of them were glorified button mashing fests and quarter munchers. Not so old fans will remember the 3D games put out by the likes of AKI, THQ and the more modern ones from 2K games. But this series goes back to a different era, starting on the Turbografx-16. Japanese wrestling games had always had an edge on their American counterparts until relatively recent years. These asian games were based on timing, rather than slamming buttons (making them harder for little kids I suppose, but just the thing pre-arthritic older fans like my generation can finally enjoy).

This is a ""2D"" wrestling game with some 3D enhancements. It actually took 2 years for FPR to be released in North America, so this is ""really"" a game from 2005. I like ""Fire Pro Wrestling D"" for the Dreamcast better in some ways to this game, but where it really shines is in terms of polish (rather than sheer brutality) and the fact that the mods and custom content for it is about 100x more. The trouble with playing this game today is that its much more difficult to locate all of the great custom saves with thousands of community created CAWs ('create-a-wrestling'), textures, referees, etc. A few are still out there, but you'll have a harder time finding them (and you need to buy yourself an Action Replay Max for the PS2 to easily import the saves using your memory card). If you're really hard core you can get yourself two ""Multi-taps"" for your PS2 and enough controllers and play an 8 player match (yes, 4 vs 4 or all out).

The wrestling is arcade style, but in a good way. There's very little ""button mashing"" required (except to get up after after being knocked down). You hold a button to ""catch your breath"" and rest to regain strength (life bars are invisible). Two wrestlers that touch automatically go into a ""Grapple"" and you have a moment to press the right button before the other person (four types of moves possible, timing based). You hold a button to escape a pin attempt, rotate the d-pad to escape a submission hold (if memory serves, after awhile it becomes automatic). Characters have four taunts, can run (and do dash attacks), climb the turnbuckles, go out of the ring, pick up weapons, etc.

Some things you may be familiar with in other popular wrestling games don't appear here... there are no tables to put opponents through, you can't light things on fire (though certain characters can toss a fireball that singes your opponent's face), and while you can make an enemy bleed it doesn't stain the mat. There are no ""ladders"" or rope climbing. However you can have a steel cage match (not as fun as you might think, once somebody starts climbing its basically over, though I suppose pro players can do more about it), and there is an electrified barbed wire rope match (not as explosive as the electrified barbed wire cage deathmatch in the Dreamcast game, but its still fun, and brutal). You can of course play with tag teams, and do battle royales (including eliminations over the top rope). Instead of the ""barbed wire match"" like the Dreamcast game, there's a ""landmine deathmatch"" that is very similar. Outside the ring there is ""barbed wire"" strewn on the ground (which instantly triggers an explosion when touched, and then forces you back into the ring once you get up), and like the predecessor's extreme match, there are either bundles of fluorescent light tubes or boards covered with barbed wire on the turnbuckles (the DC version triggered a red ""screen flash"" when you hit these, not here though).

Gone is the ""Victory Road"" mode from the DC (but that was basically just fight every single person from every single preset fed one by one until you win). Instead you have a type of basic GM mode where you try to run promotions and earn points for putting on shows the fans want to see (I'm not that interested in such things, but if you are, give it a try). Most of the time you're just setting up your own matches, practicing and getting your friends to play.

There is a ton of customization in this game, you can have something like 825 wrestlers (125 preset, which can also be modified, plus 500 CAW slots). You can customize title belts (but it doesn't show you wearing it, sadly), referees (can't control them yourself though), and rings (you get to place a texture in the center and change the color of the ropes, mat, apron, pads, posts but no changes to the external arena). You can create your own federations and rename wrestlers, pick from hundreds of moves, and so much more. Eventually some players find themselves not playing matches anymore, just ""simulating"" them, by picking two characters (often created or tweaked) then seeing how wins, watching the two AI go at it. If this is your thing, that's another option, but I like to play. Sadly there is no online multiplayer, this is a feature that's going into Fire Pro Wrestling World on Steam though I hear.

Some things take getting used to. Because these are 2D wrestlers (though well animated) running around on various 2D planes of a 3D wrestling ring, to create the illusion of depth, at times it can be hard to ""line up"" your move, and characters may swing at air (especially when you're holding a weapon) before they line up. With practice you'll get this, and the ""timing"" too. Too much fighting or running and not enough ""resting"" will cause your character to move slow, sag his shoulders and even fall down. Matches can be over in a second if you goof up. Practice makes less imperfect.

I could go on and on about this wonderful game, but it'll have to wait for another time. Check out gameplay footage online and educate yourself on great series if you don't know about it yet. Remember, this game is more like the series that started on the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation and Dreamcast (or I suppose the GBA), not the (completely different) 3D ""avatar wrestling"" title of the same name on Xbox 360. There is a new game called ""Fire Pro Wrestling World"" that is an evolution of this title on the PC via Steam (currently in public beta I hear tell, for $20).","Fantastic ""Old School"" Wrestling game",1503878400,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

I suspect it's [priced]less than the average PS2 game because they didn't include game features like multiplayer. Perhaps this was done to get it out on the market before the Xbox game.
It has many similar qualities to the original Spiderman for PS1 and so in that regard there isn't any majorly new innovation except perhaps the Cel animation- which isn't really new either since games like Robotech already do this.
Still this limited game is quite enjoyable and the implementation is excellent.
Pros:
- Beautiful cel shading in both the game and in the cut scenes.
- Cartoon series voices are intact.
- Flying thru Metropolis' Art Deco cityscape is really cool.
- Supe flies like Supe. He can do loop-the-loops!
- Supe gets most of the capabilities you'd expect: super breath, heat ray, heat burst, xray vision, super hearing, super top-spin, ground stomp, high speed flight. This provides you with a variety of ways to dispose of the villians.
Cons:
- Can't just pick up arbitrary objects- like cars, except in specific cases.
- Can't crash thru buildings in Metropolis.
- No multiplayer mode- would be awesome if you could recreate the duel between General Zod and Supe in Superman II.
- Would be nice if there is a way to quickly turn around 180.

- sword fighting
- Wakeboarding
- Frisbee
- Archery
- Basketball
- Air Sports
- Canoeing
- Cycling
- and some others

So far I played:
-Bowling- I like bowling. I first played the 10 pin game and unlocked the 100 pin game (which is cool because it is like a chain reaction seeing all the pins drop).
- Wakeboarding- That is sort of hard because in order to receive points you need to hit the board on the water at just the right time
- Swordfighting- I like that it is cool. If you ever seen that TV Show Wipeout, it is almost like that because you play on a platform and when you Wipeout the opponet he/she falls into the water
-Frisbee- It is kind of hard because you have too aim and throw at a target in order to recieve points. In the game they let you throw the Frisbee to a cute litte MII Dog, and also in it there is a mode where u try and pop balloons.

As a veteran gamer I did not find the controls of Splatoon to be particularly difficult however the motion controls using the Wii U's gamepad can be a bit cumbersome at times. I discovered that you can play by using the Wii U Pro Controller or a combination of the classic controller + wii remote. Every character in Splatoon is so wonderfully detailed. Even when you lose, the animation of your character banging his head on the ground, is so hilarious and brilliantly animated! The online regular matches only have a few maps in the rotation however I've read that Nintendo plans to release new maps and game modes later on (edit June 1st, 2015 - Nintendo releases 2 new maps for online matches + opens up ranked matchmaking).

Despite all my encouraging words about Splatoon - there is one negative part of the game. There is a lack of local multiplayer options available. 1 vs 1 consists of a balloon popping game which I found to be particularly loathsome. I went from playing hours of painting maps and annihilating my enemies to popping balloons? Doesn't make any sense and I'm hoping Nintendo offers a remedy soon...

This disc brings together a huge collection of almost all of Sega's best games from the Genesis era. All the expected titles are here -- the Sonic the Hedgehog games, the Golden Axe series, Space Harrier, Shinobi and much more -- plus some awesome stuff you might not expect. (Presumably we'll see games like Afterburner and the lock-on version of Sonic 3 + S&Knuckles in a second installment.)

Two of the biggest reasons to be wowed by this set are:

Phantasy Star series -- With the four games included here (1-4), you get some of the best RPGs of the era and dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay. The ahead-of-its-time Phantasy Star, the stunning Phantasy Star II (which influenced the direction of Final Fantasy in a big way), the amazing epic Phantasy Star IV. Just these four games alone are worth the $30. Heck, DOUBLE that. No fan of JRPG's should go without playing these.

Shining series -- Two predecessors of the popular Final Fantasy Tactics series (Shining paved the way for this sort of game) as well as a first-person dungeon crawler, these are fan favorites for a reason. They're great. Ahead of their time and they hold up great.

And SO many more. Shinobi. The difficult roguelike Fatal Labyrinth. Fun platformer Alex Kidd. Tetris clone Columns. Even coin-op classic Zaxxon! A HUGE collection!

All games allow you to save at any time, in any game, anywhere. This is a GREAT feature. Plus it saves high scores, has full 16:9 support for widescreen TVs, and you can toggle on graphics smoothing to make the games look even better than they did upon release. It's a dynamite feature. (The ""museum"" and interview extras are a nice bonus, too.)

All in all this is one of the best retro gaming bargains of the year. Got my copy a few days ago and already have loads of hours under my belt. The inclusion of not one but TWO fan favorite RPG series gives this disc an enormous amount of play value.

The final answer is: OH YEAH!!!!

WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 takes a major step up from last year's SD vs Raw by amping up what they felt the gamers wanted amped up and removing a few things that were not too liked.  One major boost is to the graphics.  As before, each of the wrestlers looks so close to their real life counterparts you would almost swear that you were watching an actual WWE show.  The stars come out to their actual entrances (moves and music) but yes, there are a few who it seems the theme clearances couldn't be gained.  Nevertheless it really is a major difference.

Also new to the game are a few new match types to take on.  The Bra and Panties match that we loved dearly (admit it guys...:)) has now become the Fulfill Your Fantasy match in which you have to fill a ""Fantasy Meter"" to win the match.  It is fun, seeing as you get to start a pillowfight or go old school and try to rip your opponent's clothes off...

Also added to the match types is the Buried Alive match.  In this match you have to fight your way up to a point on the stage where a coffin awaits.  There you must toss your opponent into the coffin, close the lid and win by basically burying your opponent.  This is a match that gets fun dependent on which superstar you use to take the match.  What's more is that it is one of 100 (!!) match types to take on in the game.

Other new features include an all new General Manager Mode where you take on the role of GM of either show and try to go through a year by setting up matches and shows to garner the biggest fan base, Superstar specific storylines that change dependent on choices made throughout the season, a new Locker Room where the trophies and accolades you win through your wrestling are stored, an amazing roster of several current and former WWE Superstars including the legendary Bret ""Hitman"" Hart (THANK YOU!!!), the ability to steal your opponent's taunts and finishers, a new Possum Pin where you can fake out and pin your opponent, voices for your own created characters, the chance to take on either the WWE or World Heavyweight Champion in Exhibition mode and more.

The few drawbacks come with the commentary during your matches, which come from Jim Ross and Jerry ""the King"" Lawler from Raw and Michael Cole and Tazz from SmackDown which sound at times like it was forced for them to read.  Also, the WWE Championship belt in all modes is the current ""Spinner"" championship held by Raw's John Cena.  Yet periodically you see the old ""modernized"" WWE Championship and you won't get that one.

But even with these flaws, WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2006 sets the bar high for any future WWE titles (it is unknown if this is the final WWE title for PS2 with the PS3 on the horizon) and sends Midway a little message as it begins to make the game for WWE's main rival TNA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

It's better than waiting a few more years (probably around 2010-2011) for all three episodes to come out at once. Other than that, what can I say that hasn't already been said? The graphics are pretty much the same, however better lighting effects thanks to new HDR (seen in the ""Lost Coast"" demo) and you definitely notice it.

The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star on fun is because there are a few levels set in complete darkness. Your flashlight is the only source of light, and it feels a lot like Doom 3. I'm not saying it was poorly done, heck it was very well done... because it scared the bagezes outta me! I'm just not a fan of fighting in the dark (of course I don't think Gordon is either). Bravo to Valve because it did just what they wanted!

It's been said that every episode will focus game play on one new feature. In E1 it's the accompaniment of Alyx. She is pretty much by your side for the majority of the game. A few times you will have to separate to complete tasks, but soon reunited. In no way did her presence ever get in my way or cause me to die, so the people complaining about the AI are just bad at playing video games. She actually helps a lot by providing cover fire.

But theres lots of added twists for example you switch drivers with the Z button, when you get hit by an item the person in back of the vehicle can fall off and be dragged for a few seconds and eventually get back up onto the vehicle, its fun to play solo but its more fun to play with another person or more people up to four players which is pretty sweet. The only negative I would give is that if you fall on a banana peel you can't hit the B and Z button and then get a quick note bubble so thats the only down fall of this game where as in the Nintendo 64 that was not the case. It's a game for the whole family to play especially kids and parents its very awesome to play on the 2006 model Wii (that model Wii is backwards compatible and will play Gamecube games.

However, as of now, the developers are active in keeping supporters in the loop and are consistently offering updates/fixes to any noticeable issues. I would recommend you grab this in a sale -- otherwise, I don't think it's worth any more than 15 bucks. That's not to say it's a bad or broken game, but the content is still relatively bare bones at the moment. If you can get this anywhere below that price, then I think this is a worthy investment.

The visuals are fresh and mesmerizing, the sound effects outperform my headphones, and the gameplay is very well-developed despite the game's early state. Just be prepared to die dozens of times before you can survive even a slightly significant amount of time. This is not something you can just breeze through with ease and I was caught off guard more times than I can count. Strategy is not an option here -- it is a necessity. Also, I have to commend the creators for purposely excluding zombies, which have become excruciatingly tiresome in the ""horror"" and ""survival"" genres. My only gripe with the game so far is that wolf attacks are all too frequent, so hopefully this issue is remedied in a future patch.

Yes you have to download through Origin which I didn't know either, but looking back at the product page it tell you in bold letters Origin required to activate, but once I got everything situated and downloaded, it was fine, the download took me around 3 hours or so, but I was ok with it because I had some last minute stuff to do.. But once installed immediately started looking around the new stuff, there isn't a lot of clothing though, and I do believe only 2 hair style for woman without accessories and a ton of hair with accessories with hats and shells an things..
The festival lots are really neat, if your playing Sunset Valley the festival lot will replace central park.. But you have to place the lot on there, and wait a few sim days like maybe 2 and a pop up will come up and say the summer or whatever season your in is starting.. The calander for the sims in the summer time have a red circle around Monday which they are calling Leisure Day..
You can't change the seasons in any other order but you can turn off which seasons you don't want and you can turn off Hail and rain and etc.. You can also set the seasons for as long as you want, I believe 28 days or for as little as 3 days..
I haven't yet seen an alian and I hope I don't lol... But they are in the game and you can not make them in CAS.. Basically if you ignore them, they will go away..
I was [playing through the summer season and everyone was sleeping and my screen flashed and heard a loud bang, bought jumped out of my seat lol.. It felt very real the thunderstorm.. Really excited to get to fall and winter ( I think I am gonna set that one for 28 days because I love winter!) The skating rinks are a nice touch.. The rafts are cute and you can nap on them in the pool or in the ocean! You can also get the weather now on tv but that thing lies lol... It told me 90 degrees and sunny, so I decided to take my teenage girl and her high school boyfriend on a date to the beach and just as we got there, it started to pour rain! So, don't always believe the weatherman lol.. But by your sim theres a sun that you can mouse over it tells you what degree it is outside and how many days til the next season.
When I had played The sims 3 my clock, I could never get it to speed up, then I did an update and bought town life stuff and my clock, I could speed through the time like when they are sleeping, and I noticed a little lag within the game, with seasons, I no longer have a lag and runs better than it did before, I am also on a laptop with minimum specs, when I did the can you run it for the sims 3 base game, it told me I failed, but I bought it anyways and it works just fine, but when I used that to check for seasons it told me I passed with flying colors and was over the required specs, I found it some what odd, but I am not gonna complain!

Start with the single player and it will blow your mind with it's gripping story.  If the prologue doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you have no soul.

The single player story is about 20h of content with another 6 or so with the left behind expansion.

I then found a video to where you can cut the little plastic thing on the P11s that hold the two cables together so you can separate the USB and 3.5 far enough to where you can plug in the USB to the PS4, and the 3.5 into the controller but the idea of having a cable connected to my "" Wireless "" DS4 made NO SENSE to me AT ALL.

The DAC1 by Turtle Beach which claims to allow you to use your older Turtle Beach headsets with the PS4 while at the same time still allowing you to control the chat and game sound separately so I ordered it which ran me $35.

Also, there will be a double ended 3.5 cable in the packaging that you actually don't need if you're running the same setup as me. If you look at the picture of the DAC1, you will see the USB cable, and 3 holes. The hole NEXT to the USB is for the optical cable that comes with the DAC1. You run that cable to the BACK of the PS4, and then you plug your P11's USB and 3.5 into the bottom of the DAC1.

You really start to care about each of them because they all have unique, intriguing, and emotional back stories that are played out in a perfectly natural way as you play the game.  This game truly is a masterwork of writing and pacing and you will really find yourself connecting with and loving the characters which in turn makes you become invested in the story.  The storyline is incredible and although you may think it is one of those a dime a dozen ""save the world, defeat the badguy"" stories I assure you it is anything but.  True it is a ""save the world"" game but it has just such a creative take on it that it feels like something completely unique and fresh.  The villain is awesome and there are some very nice twists of sorts that keep you wondering what's going to happen next the entire time.  The world is also just so brilliantly fleshed out that you feel like you know it personally.  The music is some of the best I've ever heard in a game also.  Most importantly arguably however is that the gameplay is just simply unbelievable.  This game has the most entertaining battle system I have ever played.  The double techs and triple techs were such a brilliant idea and something that I'm surprised no other RPG since has picked up on (besides Chrono Cross sorta but that doesn't count).  The time aspect of this game is just flawlessly done, I don't wanna spoil anything so I'm not going talk about but its nothing short of mindblowing.  Also it has some of the best sidequests I've ever played in the game.  I'm sorry for this long rant I just love this game so much!

I can't get enough of it, and ignore the duesches that say the sims 2 is better, becuase trust me, it's not!

The complete collection comes in a box  and in 4 cd's, one you put in after the other, and on a pentium 4 256 mb or any other pc it takes about 20 minutes to install. That Vista s--t makes it very difficult to run, but after right clicking run as administrator it will work like butter. Once it loads that silver screen that says mammal matrix and the like( this is were it comes down to personal computers power and not every computer the same, loading times can take from 40 seconds to 25 minutes). It will take you to the neighborhood screen and you get the feel of the neighobrhood, and there are 3 families for your personal enjoyment, for a first timer the first sim you make or get from the families screen will be horribly managed and just about non recoverable, so it takes a lot of practice. The music is extraordinary, and gives a feeling that your neighborhood is somewhere in New england or the midwest. The carpool things is terrific, and there is just too much to comment about here.

The sims do get occasionally stuck in one place, too fix that just go to buy mode and move an object. There are just about no bugs in the game, and I know I can download mods to put a little spice into my sex life( A lot of people were wanting that, before they just had too think about what they did after the sim kissed and did little things...). And there are even more objects for download( be very careful when doing this as some of these objects may not be compatible or may have bugs or cause crashes and all kinds of problems).

In short, the difference between the regular and Pro model is that the latter comes with the Pro chat adapter.  I had purchased the Pro chat adapter separately two months earlier, so I got the same experience.

I have a very large head.  Most headphones, at best, fit very tight against the sides of my head.  The XO Seven does fit quite snugly against my head, however there are two mitigating factors.  The XO Seven ear cups are quite large, larger than the XO One ear cups.  They press more against my head than pressing/pinching my ears against my head.  The padding is soft so it forms to the shape of my head, providing a nice seal and distributing the force pretty evenly.

My experience with customer service was positive.  A plastic part of the headband, just above the ear cup, broke.  Since they fit firmly on me, I'm sure there is a lot of stress on the parts.  I submitted a ticket, explained what happened, provided the information they requested, and mailed the headphones by themselves (detaching the mic and cable, per their instructions).  Although they say 7-10 business days after they receive the package, I had a replacement a week after they received the package.

We got a Wii a while back because we thought it would be good way for us to enjoy games together and have some fun with friends.  I really enjoyed Wii bowling and my husband liked most of the sports games.  But I didn't see any games for the Wii that I thought would make me a dedicated player.

Then Mario Kart Wii came out.  My little sister had an N64 back in the 90s and I had played Mario Kart with her--it was fun, but I always had a hard time with the joystick controls.  Out of nostalgia for that old game, I ordered Mario Kart Wii and an extra wheel.  I was instantly hooked.  The Wii Wheel makes it alot easier to manuver the car (for me, someone who had never gotten the feel of a joystick) and the tracks, the different characters and the cars all make it lots of fun. Now i'm working my way through the different cups at the different speeds, and I'm starting to race online using Mario Kart WFC--which I must say, really puts your skills in perspective!

My husband really likes Mario Kart Wii too.  He had never played the game before and normally doesn't like racing games, but he said the weapons, different characters and zany tracks make it interesting.  And it's great that it's something we--with our wildly different gaming skill sets--can play together.

I would recommend this game for someone who enjoyed earlier versions of Mario Kart, or who likes to play multiplayer games (you can always play a multiplayer game with Mario Kart Wii because of the online games), or maybe even for someone who isn't that into video games but just wants something that is lots of fun.

This is by far my favorite of all the Lego games, however to do everything it is going to cost a lot of money in the end, even if you catch good sales! Somehow, I think it is worth it though for all that you get (at least if you don't pay full price for everything).

Pros:
1.) Story-line is amazing... I venture to say the best of all the story-lines, and the mash-up of all the different characters and worlds works really well! Each level takes place in a different world (Wizard of Oz, Ghostbusters, Portal, Scooby Doo, etc).
2.) Characters: There are a lot of different characters from many beloved titles, and it is cool to be able to build them and their vehicles. The characters also interact with each other in funny ways at times... although some of the dialogue is annoying (Unikitty saying to the Wicked Witch ""If you spent more time singing, you wouldn't be so ""wicked"", witch"" gets annoying fast).
2b.) Doctor Who's appearances are awesome! And so is playing a level in his world... okay this is just something awesome for us Doctor Who fans, but I thought I'd add it as a sub-point.
3.) The main story has a good length to it, and it will be fun to replay once I have all the characters necessary to get all the minikits.
4.) Hub worlds are more fun to play than any single hub world I have experienced - the variety really makes it stay fresh for longer. Individual hub worlds of course are smaller than a typical Lego game hub world, but each universe represented has its own hub world that can be played once you have a character from that world. There will be a total of 14 different hub worlds in season one, and I have already played most of them for hours as they have a lot to do in them!
4b.) Hub World races are cool!
5.) It is very kid friendly. Even my six year old daughter is able to play along in the Hub worlds pretty well, although the puzzles are a bit complex for her, so we don't often play story levels together.
6.) Works well in 2 player mode, although sometimes difficulties can arise on the split screen.
7.) Using the game pad can be a lot of fun and adds something to the game itself. Some puzzles require you to move characters around the pad to do different things, and some boss attacks require you to move the character to another space on the pad. You will definitely want to keep the game pad close to your chair. We use a small kids table for this purpose.

Cons
1.) Price and the multitude of packs you have to buy if you want to do everything! I have already spent about $250 and estimate I will spend close to $350 by the end of Season 1 and I have bought things on incredible sales and only bought what was essential to have the skills to complete all tasks. Be prepared to buy about 11 fun packs/ team packs, as well as the Level packs if you want to complete the full game. There is an in game hire-a-hero feature, but it does not always work properly and can get expensive on in game studs.
2.) Hire-a-hero is a bit glitchy, incomplete, and sometimes resets after your hero expires after just 30 seconds. It is supposed to be a feature to keep you from having to buy all the charcters, but sometimes the hire-a-hero fails to pop up (he explodes before you can purchase); other times you cannot complete the full task in 30 seconds, which means rehiring in some instances, and the task resetting and being a waste of studs in others. Also, you cannot purchase vehicles that are necessary for some tasks (Jurrassic World Team Pack is necessary to use the Gyrosphere).
3.) There are a handful of minor glitches that can be annoying at times, but do not detract too much from the game playing experience.

I might want to rate this 4.5 just because of the price and the fact you have to buy so many characters to be able to do it all, but then again for the starter pack it is well worth the $70 investment it currently is priced at (and I got it for $55), plus if you are not a completionist you don't have to get everything to enjoy the game... just slowly buy the packs you want. Since, you cannot give a 4.5 rating, and it really is a really awesome game, I will give it a 5 star rating!",Best Lego Game Ever... but pricey for completionists,1452124800,,"{'Edition:': ' Starter Pack', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

It plays like an action rpg where you have objectives,  missions,  gear,  level increases,  etc. I'm playing the ""legends"" mode and each level has its own story,  characters and bosses.  The objective of each level starts out the same,  try to get more keeps than the enemy by defeating  enemy troops.  This evolves as the level progresses because you are directed to different areas of the map to fulfill side quests and missions.  So you can ignore a hoard of enemies and focus on the objective if you feel like.

The game play is a lot of fun,  the only problem I have is that it can be easy to get lost on the maps since the mini map is a bit small.

Key word there was had.  Dead Space is by and far one of the most frightening video games you will ever play, taking the idea of ""monsters on a space ship"" and upping the ante in nearly every department.  You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer dispatched to the ship Ishimura after contact has been lost.  It doesn't take long to learn that the crew of the Ishimura have been mutated into horrible creatures, and it's up to you to wreak bloody havoc upon them and learn what happened.  First and foremost, Dead Space features some of the most horiffic creature designs you'll catch in a video game.  These Necromorphs aren't all that easy to take down either, leading up to some just plain awesome boss battles to boot.  What Dead Space manages to accomplish in terms of innovation is also very much worth noting, as the traditional elements like a health meter are featured right on your character via a meter going down his spine, and telling how much ammo you have left can be seen when you raise your weapon into position.  Elements like these make Dead Space an all the more immersive gaming experience, and the game's enthralling story only adds to it.  Technically speaking, Dead Space is a marvel in terms of graphics and sound design, offering so many moments of brilliance amidst the horror.  The game is blood-curdlingly violent, and being able to improvise using your surroundings during battle adds to this as well.  The ship itself is wonderfully designed and gives off a feeling of claustrophobic dread; all of which helps add up to make Dead Space a brilliant and immersive survival horror experience.  If there's any flaws to be found, it's that the mission objectives can get repetitive, but other than that, Dead Space is nearly flawless.  All in all, you are unlikely to play any better, or scarier, survival horror games now or in the near future, and even if survival horror isn't really your thing, you should definitely check out Dead Space regardless.",One of the most frightening video games ever made,1225584000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's significantly shorter than that of PS3's controller and, until this Energizer add-on, so originally named ""Extra Life Charge System"" I had decided to accept it and learn to live with it. But I don't have to now.

I generally don't like and don't use third party enhancements to my controllers because, whether we like it or not, it's hard to come up with something better than a peripheral that a company with extensive gaming experience such as Sony has spent probably years to optimize. But, here's the exception. The Energizer product is shaped and sized in a way that does not impede my gaming experience in any way and I simply forgot it existed after probably 15 minutes of using it. It's that good. It goes underneath the Dualshock 4 and it plugs into its charging port. It doesn't block anything and while, of course, it adds a little weight, I stopped noticing it within minutes. For some reference, I do play some controller-intensive games such as Bloodborne and Diablo but I can't say how the extra weight and the little battery pack would affect some even more intense shooters such as, let's say, Call of Duty.

The way this works is: you attach the battery packs to the Dualshock 4 and then you drop it on the base for charging. The battery pack has some metal contacts on its back and there is no need to actually plug it in. You simply drop it into the base and you pick it up whenever you need it. The base lights up yellow if the controller is charging and blue when the charging completes. The light is a good thing to have as feedback, just in case you're wondering whether you dropped it into the base the right way.

That's about it. Energizer claims double life with the back attached and they may be right. The controllers definitely last longer now and, since there's no need for plugging them in, it's more likely that I'll be dropping a half-full controller into the charger and it will be full and ready to go next time I need to use it.

5.0,True,"05 6, 2017",AXA12TVIINQ7H,B01CEFEMFW,SPoon,"What an awesome product from Logitech. Well built and designed splendidly. From the nice audible mouse clicks of its buttons to how light the mouse actually is this is a very well thought out product.

The mouse responds instantaneously on wireless as far as I can tell. On an older wireless Logitech mouse I had to click multiple times for the click to register. Not being attached to a wire also means more freedom. There is no unnecessary wire pull that may occur with a cord. You can use the mouse while tethered to reduce the response time, but wireless has worked perfectly for me so far. The cord is quite sturdy and has some heft to it. If you are using the mouse while tethered you may not want the wire to dangle as it can cause wire pull due to the heftiness of the cord.

The mouse has a matte finish which is a nice touch, but Logitech also decided to throw in some glossy pieces which is very susceptible to scratches and fingerprints. The DPI buttons, scroll wheel button, forward and backward buttons, and parts of the underside of the mouse utilizes glossy plastic. For a premium product I would expect a manufacturer to use premium materials through and through so the choice for Logitech to use such a material is a mystery to me. Especially on buttons that are frequency touched it is let down for an OCD person like myself. However, this is just a minor cosmetic problem and has no affect on the performance of the mouse itself.

The left and right mouse clicks have a very fulfilling feeling when pressed. It does not truly matter where you click these buttons as it registers just the same. The scroll wheel has a nice rubberized finish and provides a bit of grip while scrolling. Hyperscroll can be activated and disabled by pressing the button directly beneath it. The slower scroll provides a tactile feedback as it has a ""click"" with each subtle turn of the wheel. Under the scroll wheel button are the two DPI buttons for quick profile switching. For some the DPI buttons may be quite small, but for me the buttons worked as intended. You can have up to five different DPI profiles. The profile you are using is indicated by the light bars directly beneath the buttons.

Although the DPI on this mouse have a rating of 12,000 I have yet to come anywhere remotely close to that figure. At about 3,000 DPI the mouse can easily zip from the left to the right of my 4K display with little effort. You can adjust the DPI for more precision or speed at a finger's touch readily.

The mouse may be awkward to hold at first due to its size and ambidextrous design so it make take some time to adjust. The forward and backward buttons are placed a bit too high when I have my hand resting on the mouse. Depending on the size of your hands and how you grip the mouse this may or may not be the mouse for you. On a side note, the forward and backward buttons can be completely removed or added to one or both sides of the mouse. The buttons are magnetically attached so swapping the pieces out are easily done.

On the bottom of the mouse, dust can easily get caught along the edges of the glide stickers so cleaning it regularly is a must. The matte finish on the majority of the mouse also provides a nice resistance to fingerprint and sweat.

The programmable RGB indicators are also a nice addition. Keep in mind if you are connected wirelessly with the lighting on you will get up to 24 hours of battery life compared to 32 hours with the lights off. There is a power switch on the bottom of the mouse so do not forget to turn off the mouse when not in use.

Overall, I really enjoy the looks and feel of this Logitech product. Price may seem a bit excessive, but having something I enjoy using on a day to day basis may outweigh the cost. This mouse may not be for everyone so I recommend giving it a test drive before purchasing. If you do decide to purchase this mouse you will not believe how light this mouse actually is. I can lift and readjust the mouse with little effort.

The packaging is also worth mentioning as it should with a premium product. Logitech has designed the perfect box for presenting such a premium device. Side the top cover off and you are presented with a box. Open the box like a piece of jewelry and basting in all its glory is your precious new mouse.

The game is easy to pick up and play and the story is very well told and easy to follow. The gameplay is familiar to anybody who has played 3D adventure games, and the overall quality and polish is just great. If you like PlayStation games and enjoy the unique charm of polygon characters and pixelated explosions that take you back to 1995, then this game is for you.

And to top it all, the game is FREE. Yes, it's free, and brand new, sealed with the original PlayStation seal, you only pay for the shipping, which is [...]. I'm not kidding. My guess is that people were too busy with the PlayStation 2 and other consoles back in 2002 to give PlayStation games any attention anymore, so there are so many new copies of this game they're just giving them away. My advice is get this game while it's dirt cheap, because there will come a day in which they will be rare and expensive, much like the Nintendo GameCube games are nowadays.

Final Fantasy VII is no different, with the perfect amount of Playstation flair to compliment, not overtake the strong story and game system that are the series' hallmarks.
While old-school gamers may prefer pre-defined roles for each character, the Materia system is still meritorious on its own, allowing uncomplicated customization of characters and adding great depth to gameplay.  Character development proceeds well, with nearly every battle in the game having purpose (unlike some RPGs where hours are spent ""leveling up"" to get characters past an obstacle), and the in-game pointers help clarify locations whenever the lush graphics are unclear.  The soundtrack is otherworldly, with several haunting, beautiful songs that are simply unforgettable.
But Final Fantasy's core has always been its great storylines, and this installment has one of the best.  Characters develop and mature realistically, and you get to know each one intimately, almost feeling kinship with some of them.  The plot is suitably but not comically epic, and the main struggle plays out better than most Hollywood movies.  Nearly everyone will laugh and cry at various parts of the game, a feat precious few video games have ever accomplished.  From a storyteller's perspective the shocking twist at the game's midpoint is perhaps too easy a way to draw emotion from the player, but there is no denying its effectiveness, as it is one of the most memorable scenes in video game history.
Square has released many RPGs on Playstation, some of them terrific on their own, but none have topped their first, a must-purchase for all Playstation owners.

Coming from somebody who has both games, let me tell you its better when it comes to gameplay, graphics, concept, sound, you name it. The players in Madden really look deformed, they all have tiny waste, huge shoulders and all look 5'9. And the gameplay is so unrealistic, its crazy. Football games aren't supposed to be realistic, but its supposed to at least be close. In Madden, you can pass like 1000 mph and run 300 mph, for example, and the tackles and the way the players run look so fake. Meanwhile, ESPN's graphics are modeled according to their real life statures because they put those dots on all of the players to get their exact shape and size. And the gameplay in ESPN is far better. You can actually play a close game and exciting game unlike Madden where you win the game 155-0 everytime. And another reason why ESPN 2K5 kills Madden this year is cause its just 20 bucks! Thats how much video games should cost, not a fourth of the ps2 itself (50 dollars).

5.0,False,"02 22, 2006",A1ZTS02PCDQ568,B00009WAV4,Herbie,"Are you all kidding or what?  In the context of the game's release, Mega Man Zero 2 is the best in the series!  Just compare and contrast the original with this sequel, and the results are obvious.  GameSpot's review on this game is accurate, but it harshly condemns this game for being so difficult.  The difficulty, most would concur, is pronunciated in the beginning, where Zero has little health and must fight two Golems and a Mecha Scorpion...and survive the onslaught!  I admit I was a bit daunted by the number of mini-bosses in the game's onset, but after the first batch of bosses (namely after Phoenix Magnion) the game does not hate you as much.

The game's sprites look wonderful.  Mega Man Zero features more hand-drawn characters and landscapes, and that is okay, but Zero 2's looks are simply amazing for a handheld game.  Not only have the graphics sharpened, but the quality of the game's music has improved greatly.  Some of the stand-out tracks include the Train level, the Computer Zone (both the Rooftop and the base) and the Neo Arcadia Temple.  How can reviewers say that the graphics have been recycled from Mega Man Zero, when plainly the characters look more vibrant and well-animated?

The difficulty in the game is also increased by the number of levels where you largely depend on the Chain Rod to traverse.  The Forest of Dysis, for instance, got on my nerves because I had to jump a certain distance in order for my Chain Rod to grapple on the floating machine.  You can't get too close to the agent you wish to latch on to.  I learned that the hard way.  Another thing is to swing to the other side correctly.  In a very realistic manner, you to have swing back and forth to gain momentum prior to leaping across, or you may find yourself exploding to bits after 4 or 5 tries.

The cyber-elf system is a little easier to use, but it's not dramatically different from the first game's system.  Basically you talk to Ciel if you want to download a cyber-elf (they're basically sprites that endow Zero with upgrades and abilities), but some cyber-elves require that you feed them Energy Crystals, or you can't transfer them.  As the game progresses, you might want to consider downloading the cyber-elves that increase your MAX energy because the bosses get bigger (but not always badder).  Too bad this affects your Mission Result ranking permanently, for the rest of the game.  I can't complain however, because even though I finished the game with a C Rank, I obtained 99% of the EX Skills after each Boss Battle.

Cutscenes are considerably more abundant in this game than in any  of the other Mega Man Zero installments.  Particularly astouding graphics are what makes this game such an enjoyable experience, in spite of the difficulty setting and the acquisition of Zero's forms, which is my subsequent topic.

Zero grows stronger not only by the collection of EX Skills he absorbs from his adversaries, but also by obtaining ""Forms.""  These forms are like a physical evolution.  They can only be attained when you embark on a Mission:  That means you CANNOT obtain a form on an already completed mission!!!  That makes forms a rarity, because you get them only by performing certain kinds of actions.  For example, you get the X Form (so called because of X's weapon of choice, the Buster, and by the Form's color, blue) by KILLING 50 enemies with your Buster before the Mission ends.  If you want to know about Zero's other forms, check out gamefaqs.com.

The plot that drives Mega Man Zero 2 is as engrossing as the first game's.  After separating yourself from the Resistance Base for a time, Zero wants to find a purpose for living, as well as search for clues about his past.  However, he's in a rut, and he looks for Ciel and the Resistance.  When he is rescued by the Resistance Reploids, he discovers that the leadership and management of the Reploids has been passed down from Ciel to a mysterious figure named Elpizo.  He was formerly from Neo Arcadia, but he was ostracized (kicked out) and is now the Commander of the Resistance.  As Zero takes on Elpizo's orders to infiltrate Neo Arcadia and ultimately destroy it, we find that he's got a hidden agenda running.  The Dark Elf, a creature that used to be benign and which was X's hope to ending the Elf Wars a 100 years ago, is now a source of evil energy.  Elpizo is obsessed with the Dark Elf and will do anything to get his hands on its boundless power.  While this game doesn't reveal TOO much about Zero's relationship to X or their past, it doesn't mean this game isn't good.  It keeps you interested in what other things will transpire.  Play Mega Man Zero 3 and you will come to learn a lot, but you might not think that game as challenging or as fun as Mega Man Zero 2...but that might just be my personal opinion. :)  It's so much fun kicking the crap out of Leviathan, Fefnir and Harpuia, I'll tell you that much!","Sage, Fairy, Fighting",1140566400,2,,

Graphics: I know everyone says the graphics could be better, I still think they're great, especially for a game made that long ago. I probably think this because alomst all of my 52 PS2 games were made at least a year ago. These graphics are better thanthose in sly 3 and thats a brand new game.

Multiplayer: Good enough. Horse is fun and playing online is too. King of the hill is my favorite and trick attack is good also.

Cheats: If you type in watch_me_xplode at the beginning it will give you all of the cheats, levels, and skaters. Most of the cheats stink but Perfect rail, manual, and skitch, cool specials, hoverboard, flame, and stats 13 are really useful. I beat the game the first time without cheats and then I beat again with cheats, the first time took me a month. I think I beat it the second time in 2 days.

Levels:

Colledge: a fun and easy level with lots of vert and street stuff

San Fransisco: Bleh. I don't like this level because it has way too many open spaces and street stuff.

Alcatraz: My favorite level, cool challenges, high rails, it's a vert level

Kona: Better than San Francisco, very street, hard challenges, an ok level.

Shipyard: ohhh this level is so bad it hurts to play it. impossible challenges and way too much water.

London: a good mix of street and vert, pretty easy.

Zoo: I love zoo. My 2nd favorite level. fun challenges, another great mix of street and vert

The levels you have to buy

Carnival: Some fun challenges, otherwise a lot like shipyard

Chicago: this level is so hard you cant even do it with cheats. Otherwise pretty fun.

Characters: Most of them are pretty good. Unlock Jango Fett and they'll all seem like toddlers that are desperatly trying to skateboard. Created players are fun to use because you can give them any tricks you want. Even Jango Fett's. Even though Tony Hawk is the best skater you can use (without cheats) his pro challenge at the end of the game is pretty hard, just a warning. Jamie Thomas's pro challenge is so easy a 2 year old could do it, no offence to those of you who are stuck on it. There are different names for created characters that will do different things to them. One of these names is kraken, try it out.

Create-a-park: So fun, so addicting. I spent all of today building parks. If you are going to play against your friend, you can make the park so you have the advantage. Better than playing at a normal park, especially shipyard.

If you want to buy this game, I encourage you to because it is truly a great game",This game is Awesome,1131148800,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Some things in the game have changed slightly, and things like the graphics and mini games have changed dramatically. It's the same old story though; you are the brave son of Ortega growing up in a small town. You must then create characters to help you on your quest to destroy the evil Demon Lord. There are useful character classes like Warriors, Fighters, Cleric and Wizards. Then there are useless character classes like Jesters, Dealers and Thieves. To top it off, a huge Gameboy improvement is the game is that the characters now have different personalities (such as brave, romantic, honest, jock and selfish), which determine how they gain hit points, magic points, intelligence, agility and so on when they level up. The game is a very nicely diverse RPG, because in some cases you must first go to a town, then go off to a tower and destroy a boss and his minions, but other times you must go to a castle, talk with a king, then go into a cave, find an item in a treasure chest, go to a town, give that item to someone who will give you a different item that the king wanted! There are fun mini games, such as the old ""monster fights"" where you bet on a monster to win in a battle against monsters, but something new from the NES version is that the game lets you bet double or nothing when you win once! The second mini game is a track where you are given dice to roll, which you will move spaces according to the dice to either tricks, traps, treasures or monster battles. There is a new ""field log"" which will allow a player to save anywhere in the game!

5.0,False,"06 30, 2013",A3ZP2A2SWNRCB,B00BQI3UQG,y2kfan,"Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is a tricky prospect for most people who value saving money -- this is a game that was released back in 2010 on the Wii. A little over two years ago. It's relatively still new -- and there's not that much different with this port to really justify spending even more than the Wii version costs now.

It also has some technical drawbacks. Some textures are less pretty than on the Wii. The frame rate has been cut in half. It takes another person with a 3DS and another copy of the game to do co-op. Some animations are now gone -- the in between level loading screens are now static, whereas they were beautiful in a simple way on the Wii.

But honestly, all of that does not matter in the face of one very true fact: this game is just so well designed, so fun. It feels right on the handheld. The 3D initially didn't impress me, much like the whole of the experience, but it grew in time. Donkey Kong Country Returns has always been a game about going back and forth between the background and foreground. It really fits the 3D nature of the system. If you don't enjoy or tolerate or see 3D, then the point is ultimately moot, but for those weirdos like me who really enjoy the gimmick, man, it's a treat.

The frame rate is at first very noticeable. One of many things the Wii version had going for it was how fluid the whole experience was. It was Retro studios in a nutshell -- think back on the Prime series and notice how much they consistently tried to immerse you in the experience, nary a loading screen in sight and smooth as hell frame rates. In comparison, 3D feels stodgy. It feels a bit uncomfortable. But, for what it's worth, my worries in regard to this melted away as soon as I realized how better this game felt on a handheld over a console.

There's nothing wrong with the original Returns. In some ways, obviously technical ones, it's superior. But man, this game just feels so great on a handheld. The level design alone makes this the best platformer, bar none, on the 3DS, and definitely one of the best games. It just feels so great. Hard to explain -- but halfway through world one, you'll know what I mean.

If you haven't played the Wii version, this is an absolute no brainer.
If you have, maybe go for it when it's on sale -- like it frequently is here, on Amazon. Once a total skeptic, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is one of my very favorite games on the system.",Better in 3D.,1372550400,,,

For a game which only has the player pointing, clicking and using some number keys (with the occasional keyboard shortcut like ""I"" for Inventory), this game will take a while to master. I never played Diablo 1 or 2. In fact, the only reason I ponied up the money to buy D3 is because one of my friends is a huge fan of Blizzard's games and talked me into it. Generally, I am a console gamer. Yes, I love to play Call of Duty, but I also love JRPG's. I don't know a lot of gamers out there who have the same tastes in games that I do, so that combination may seem strange.

Well, I am not really into ""point and click"" games either,but I was willing to buy D3 and give it a shot though. After 40 hours of exploring the different areas within each act and taking in the story I beat Diablo and that was that. Game over. I don't think I even attempted anything after beating the game on ""Normal"". Still, I was rather pleased with the game at that point and decided to ""shelve"" it while I went off to play Borderlands 2, Black Ops 2 and Persona 4.

When patch 1.06 released with the Monster Powers, I started the game back up to see what that had really done for the game and this was the beginning of the end. I don't know why, but I latched on like a newborn kitten to it's mother's nips. I'd been hooked! I don't know why, but the grinding and constant search for the right/better gear is so addictive. I know, ""grinding!? meh"", but seriously, there is just something about this game where clearing the same levels over and over and over is still rewarding. Maybe it's the options that each patch that Blizzard releases bring to the table or seeing your character grow or how they have balanced the game, but it's fantastic. I think I have close to 200 hours on my Monk which is a LOT for me, but maybe not for some others.

This game is easy to pick up, grind for 20 minutes and then put back down. This is great now that I have a few things going on at once outside of gaming. I can get my fix and then get back to real life. The fact that it requires an internet connection to play is kinda cruddy, but I've only had a few problems with it in the 200 hours I've put into it. I know its not a fair comparison, but I have had WAY more problems playing Black Ops 2 on Xbox live than I ever did with D3 on the PC. Blizzard has really ""wowed"" me (pun not intended) with their communications about what they would like to do in each patch before they release it. They seem open to suggestions and want to make this the best game they can. Despite all the hate thrown their way, they are still going strong. I don't know exactly how long it's been since the game released, but they support it as if it's still right after launch. How many console companies give ""two craps"" like that!? They made a game that was pretty hardcore, but have now given us options to make it as hard or as easy as we want, which definitely helps newcomers as well as hardcore Diablo vets alike.

I wait patiently for an expansion and hope that there is some sort of collector's edition of it because I am now a fan myself.

5.0,True,"05 27, 2015",A7CKZO1CBRC9U,B00008J7NZ,CopperPhoenix,"Loved playing Halo with my friends and college roommates. I have played all that have been released, and though many feel this is the best of them, I still feel it falls in second. It was so unique and so much better than anything in its time that it was the best, but Halo 3 improved on it slightly, giving it, in my opinion, top honors in the series, and likewise, top honors in all FPS videogames.
Halo 2 is better than but very similar to the original Halo. New weapons and vehicles are introduced, as well as dual wielding. While dual wielding adds a lot of depth and variety to your fighting strategy, the controls for dual wielding were somewhat unintuitive. Halo 3 fixed this, and those who say Halo 2's controls were better only say so because they have played it for so long that switching, even to better controls, is hard.
Story wise, Halo 2 was a massive improvement to the original, adding beautiful video cut scenes and a riveting plot, but it did repeat a little of the same story as the first, at one point even re-including the same tedious level (The Library) as you once again try (and fail) to save the world in exactly the same way you did before. Once again, Halo 3 improved on this. Some people didn't like playing as the Arbiter, as they wanted to hate the enemy, and playing as the Covenant rebels made it hard to hate them. I rather enjoyed the new weapon options, new enemies, and new storyline.
The music is spectacular, with many new and gorgeous tracks and arrangements added to the good of the original, many of which are still considered the best of the series and best of all video games. Halo 3 redid most of them with a live orchestra, so if you are an audiophile, Halo 3 is the version you want to listen to, though there are a few good tracks not repeated, and only to be found in Halo 2.
Graphically, Halo 2 still looks good, but you can tell it was made for the original xbox. Still good enough to play, the old graphics have their charms. If you are a sucker for graphics, and don't find any charm in antiquity, you would probably do better getting the remastered version, though it is full of glitches and does not feel the same as the original.
Online, Halo 2 was one of the most popular games ever, and was played by loyalists until online support was cut by Microsoft, this despite three newer Halo's had been made. Some may say it is hard to change, but it really is that good of a game that who can fault them? System linking is still possible.
If you like first person shooters, and liked the original, this is a must play. If you like first person shooters, and want something that feels different than Call of Duty or Battlefield, this will do it. If you like a good story, this will suit you, though you need to play Halo 3 to finish it. If you like dual wielding, Halo 2 and Halo 3 are the only ones in the series with it. In short, unless the first halo was too graphic for you, buy and play this game.

5.0,False,"01 5, 2002",A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005N7YQ,Bundt Lust,"I read all four Harry Potter books when they first came out, I saw the movie less than a week after its release, and I won a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for PC. I read a rather overbearing review that called the game ""mediocre"" and ""suitable for children only."" So, after six or seven sleepless hours spent playing ""Harry Potter"" here is my verdict (please note that I have not yet completed the game so I cannot comment on end cutscene):
Pros:
+ Excellent, detailled graphics (textures, lighting, effects) that bring Hogwarts to life
+ Cutscenes that preserve most of the suspense and humour from the book/movie
+ The game tries to closely mirror important events from the book (Quidditch matches, using the Invisibility Cloak to rescue Norbert, attending Potions, Herbology, and Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, putting Fluffy to sleep, battling Voldemort)
+ Character voice acting is above average and characters sound like their movie counterparts (only the Snape voice was a little off--trust me, I know Alan Rickman's voice when I hear it)
+ Attention to detail (except that they could have made the images in the pictures move like in the book/movie)
+ The Challenges offered a chance to try out new skills/spells and had interesting obstacles
+ The characters: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Draco, the professors....all look, act and sound like their book/movie counterparts
Cons:
- Some sequences are ridiculously easy and then the next minute are impossibly hard--lacks continuity in spots
- Some of the tasks are too contrived--i.e. Hagrid's garden caves collecting Fire Seeds
- Quidditch controls are very awkward
- No background information given, introduction was too little, story skips around in spots
- Saves are automatic and in inconvenient spots
- No way to adjust difficulty level
Final verdict: This is a game worth a look if you liked the Harry Potter books/movie. Has some very good action sequences and beautiful graphics. Medium to hard difficulty level in spots.",Impressive translation from book to screen to PC!,1010188800,22,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

5.0,False,"05 31, 2015",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00KWFCV32,Bella,"Last year, I saw a sarcastic tweet directed at the E3 Splatoon reveal from a pretty prominent geek journalist. ""4-on-4 multiplayer? I bet those servers are going to be jumping!"" Of course, if that guy had played Mario Kart 8 online, which was already out at that point, he would have known that things were already looking up on Nintendo's online front. But I digress.

After dozens of online rounds and several dozens of Miiverse interactions, not to mention the excitement of checking out daily gear and map refreshes, I can officially say that, yes, these servers are jumping. Not only that, but I can say that with Splatoon, Nintendo has confidently asserted their dominance over most of their peers when it comes to online gaming.

I say this as a seasoned veteran of all the major online shooters. Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and a ton of other, less prominent games are all tucked safely under my belt. A good portion of my life has been spent in some form of online arena, pumping anonymous people full of virtual lead. But games that have provided the constant stream of dopamine like Splatoon does have been few and far in between. In fact, I might contend that none of them have managed to excite and surprise as much as this one. Which is funny, because for starters, it's barely even a shooter.

See, as you might have heard by now, in Nintendo's first blatant pitch at the online set, you take the role of both a kid and a squid. They're called Inklings. Now, on top of being squid-kids, Inklings are both aggressive and fashionable in equal amounts . You deck yourself out in hip clothes, then buy guns that shoot obscene amounts of ink and try to lay claim over different areas of turf by painting them. If anyone gets in your way? You take them out. By inking them to death. Yep.

While, on the surface, this sounds like nothing but a kiddified version of a typical shooter, it's anything but. Players get put in teams of four and thrown into an arena. From there, they're tasked with inking every surface possible in order to claim the turf for their team. Along the way, they blow enemy Inklings into smithereens and assume a more squid-ish form to swim underneath their ink so they can traverse the varying surfaces of a given level.

It's all a bit hard to describe, but can be summed up in a succinct label: shooter/platformer. You shoot things, jump on/swim up them, then shoot more things. Rinse, repeat. Those are the basic mechanics, and they work just about as well as you'd expect a platformer from the company that practically invented them to. That is to say, very. Certainly, it takes a little bit of getting used to. There's nothing else like this on the market, and it plays like a strict hybrid of the two types of gameplay I mentioned. If you play it like a traditional shooter, your territory is going to get laid waste to. If you just focus on inking the ground and jumping on everything, you're going to get blown up constantly. This is a new type of gameplay, and as such, it demands players acquire a new set of skills in order to stand a fighting chance at it.

And really, ""different"" is the operative word to describe Splatoon. Sure, you can trace elements of it back to other games. Its influences seem to range from Super Mario Sunshine to Jet Set Radio to maybe even the Blinx 2 multiplayer. But is there really anything else like it? I'd say ""no,"" with full confidence. Maybe Nintendo hasn't created a new genre or anything quite that dramatic, but they've definitely struck on something that hasn't been touched before.

Not only that, but they've polished it to a glistening, inky shine with other trimmings. Miiverse has never been better in a game, playing both a large role in the hub world and in online matches. The ability to play a lengthy Doodle Jump-esque mini-game while waiting in lobbies is a neat touch. And the gamepad integration is brilliant, delivering the type of seamless ""using the menu while playing"" mechanic that Nintendo promised when they debuted the Wii U in 2011. The core gameplay is already great, and all of the extra, thoughtful touches added just make it that much more sweet.

But what about the amount of content in this 60 dollar, online-focused game? Pre-release, a particularly vocal batch of people were worried that Nintendo was skimping on stuff with Splatoon, that the gameplay would be fun, but there wouldn't be enough of it to go around. Admittedly, I was marginally concerned that Nintendo would follow the ""pay 60 dollars, then pay for the rest"" model that so many companies have for the past few years. But, lo and behold, all of those fears were unfounded. Not only is there a decent amount of content already here, but as of this writing, all of the future modes and maps will come in the form of free updates. Thank you, based Nintendo.

Speaking seriously, though, that's a huge boon, and one of the many reasons I'm 100% on board with Splatoon right now. Its five maps are all pretty sizable, and don't really get stale, but the fact that Nintendo is going to supplement the core package, which is already well worth sixty dollars, with free content is not only benevolent, but smart. People like me, burned by most AAA titles, will gravitate towards this game, wanting to master what's already there, and anticipating an entire slew of content updates, free of charge. On the other side of coin, people who don't want to adopt early will come to this a few months from now with a whole stash of content ready to download, including weapons, outfits, maps and modes. It's a win-win, all around, and both a practical business decision and a merciful act towards consumer wallets.

And when that latter party of players, the ones who pick it up a few months down the line, come to it, they won't get immediately ganked by a community of know-it-alls. That's because, in all my years of gaming online, shooters or no, Splatoon is perhaps the most balanced experience I've ever had. That's a big claim, and I back it up with the fact that every weapon, piece of armor and gadget has a practically even split of risk and reward. For example, snipers are powerful and can end somebody in one well-placed hit, but require being charged in order to be shot and can't be used to effectively cover turf. Assault weapons are lethal at close-to-mid range and can cover a huge chunk of land in seconds, but their lack of pinpoint accuracy and quick ammo depletion mean having to be up close, personal and smart.

There really are no definitively ""bad"" guns or equipment sets, only sets that don't work for some people. Some weapons that I lost brutally with were later used to take me out effectively several, several times in a different match. It all depends on the players, and to me, that's the mark of a truly great game.

Everything I've mentioned up until now pertains exclusively to the online component, but don't think for a second that Nintendo skimped out on single-player material. The campaign, required to unlock certain things and a good way to get your bearings, is one of their more ambitious attempts at platforming in quite a while. It adds puzzles into the addictive blend of shooting and platforming, and mixes it up with some interesting level designs that get switched up constantly. While it's a bit light in the story department, the writing is cute and funny enough, and the enemy designs are pretty adorable and unique. While the gameplay is essentially the same as the multiplayer component, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Splatoon's campaign isn't of the quality of, say, a Super Mario 3D World, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to be. Instead, it offers up a lengthy series of imaginative worlds and bosses, spiced up with a heaping helping of collectibles. Nothing more, nothing less.

But while the campaign is excellent and brimming with content, don't take that to mean that Splatoon is something you should buy if you don't plan on going online. Frankly, this is a game that is built for online play, along the lines of Team Fortress 2 or Loadout, and if you're not into that, then this isn't the game for you. The split-screen content is, sadly, lackluster, with only the two-player Battle Dojo to speak of. It's pretty frustrating that Nintendo, whose games usually have great local multiplayer, dropped the ball in this department. While, yes, I understand that this is meant to be an online-focused game, I can't help but feel that the whole package could have benefited from at least the ability to take a buddy online, a la Call of Duty, Halo, or even Mario Kart 8. It definitely hurts the overall package in my eyes.

That's about my only major complaint with Splatoon as a whole, though. I barely have another ill word to speak of it, or should I say, ill words to spill ink over. As a cohesive online package, Nintendo's new IP hits the sweet spot between accessible and competitive. The gameplay is novel but not impenetrable. The weapons are satisfying but never overpowered. The maps have a sense of cohesion but never run the risk of running together. Everything here, coupled with a stellar art direction and soundtrack, is the perfect online package. Oh, and there's a pretty neat campaign, which is a plus.

To me, this is the game that cements my long-standing suspicion about Nintendo when it comes to online-oriented games. Over the years, naysayers have sneered and said that the monolithic developer simply couldn't ""get with the times."" This proves that those people are patently wrong. This is the type of game that, I feel, Nintendo could have probably made whenever they wanted to, if they wanted to. But they didn't want to. It wasn't their focus. And now that they finally feel like actually doing it, they do it leaps and bounds better than people who have been doing it for years. With one game. Their first game of this variety, no less. This isn't a case of, ""oh, Nintendo's finally doing something right,"" and trust me, I'm somebody who's definitely picked a bone with their practices in the past.

But this? This is a case of, ""Nintendo finally decided that an online-focused game was worth their time, then blew it out of the water."" And they did. This is a perfect marriage of competitive gaming sensibilities and Nintendo's signature creativity, all rolled up into a stellar package. Splatoon is, all at once, a brilliant new IP, another fantastic Wii U title, and the most fun I've had online since the last generation of consoles.

Pros
- Ingenious gameplay that's unlike anything else.
- Bright and adorable art direction.
- An infectious, fun soundtrack.
- Balanced to perfection.
- Nintendo's best online title.
- A diverse and fun campaign.
- No launch DLC; purchases are done with in-game currency.
- Solid amiibo integration justifies the purchase.

Cons
- Offline content is fairly lackluster as a whole.
- First tutorial forces you to play with motion controls.
- More modes at launch might have been nice.

In Arcanum, you are presented with one of the most unique scifi-fantasy universes, a land where steampunk and high fantasy meet!  In fact, they not only meet, but are at odds with one another!  A key theme to the series is that an industrial revolution has hit the land and those who once held power through magic and the old ways are now falling to the rise of technology and mass production.

The character creation screen, as with most isometric games like Baldur's Gate and the like, you choose a race, their portrait (a small set of premade portraits are available), and their attributes.  One can focus on being a warrior or archer, mage or priest.  But the interesting aspect is the inclusion of technology into the mix.  Technology and magic don't get along in this world.  If you're a technologist, magic doesn't work so well for you and can oftentimes either not work or hurt your character.  The same goes for magic users.  According to the game lore, magic alters the way reality works, so instead of having easily turning gears in a machine, they start to seize up and break.  Technology has a greater chance of failing in the hands of a magic user.

The story is pretty straight forward as far as epics go.  Humble beginnings, dangerous enemy, twists and turns in the plot.  A number of the characters are memorable, mainly your first companion Virgil, but a good many of them are so stereotypical it makes one wonder if the developer couldn't have tried a little bit harder to make them more dynamic.  For instance, there is a dwarf.  What do dwarves do?  Drink and fight and talk about honor.  Congratulations, you've described one of the characters.  The elves are the same way.  Reclusive, good with bows, and wise.  Its hardly honorable to talk bad about dead men, but Troika really kicked themselves in the butt by making such forgettable characters.

Luckily, its the plot that shines and not the characters.  I don't want to spoil it, so I won't say much, but be prepared for an adventure unlike any you've had in a game before!

If you love CRPGs, have a deal of patience, and want to see a good story like you haven't seen in this genre before, this is a game you must play.

A) STORY  9/10, an amazing treat for Initiates fans

I've been in Initiates since day one and I'm a huge fan of the modern day story. The inclusion of *SPOILER* Otso Berg of the tapes from when he raided Adriano's den in Italy *end of SPOILER* are incredible for an Initiates fan like me. Fixing the computers and reading the tablets around Abstergo are amazing and full of information you won't understand if you haven't played the other games and haven't been on Initiates. This is a game for the hardcore fans.

For the historical/First Civ aspect of the game, it's as well, practically flawless. Shay's story is one of redemption (unlike Arno's story) and his character is much richer and unique than almost any other AC protagonist. I won't spoil any of it but it puts things in perpective for those fans who align with the Assassins, and a lof of resolve and determination with the fans who align with the Templars.

B) GAMEPLAY  9/10, nothing wrong with it

A lot of people will say that Rogue is a re-skin of AC4, but no one seems to care that ACR was a re-skin of ACB. Now, Rogue is a re-skin of AC4 and there's nothing wrong with that. They added a lot of unique things that add to the experience, but there are still a lot of things that are annoying, like running into the walls if you get too close to them. Naval combat is a tad more difficult than AC4 but more rewarding as well. There are multiplayer aspects that are really cool and very well implemented, and I've actually never liked AC multiplayer. Looks like Shay has even more brutal moves than Connor and Edward, and executing enemies is as rewarding (and easy) as ever.

C) GRAPHICS  8/10

Graphics are your normal AC last gen graphics, nothing really new, but I will mention that the mo-cap is very well synced to the voice acting. It was good in AC4 but it's even better in Rogue.

D) FINAL VEREDICT  10/10, it was amazing

This game is an instant favorite, it should have been the only AC game released this game. The only thing I complain about is that it was too short, but there was no useless filler in it, every scene in it was important and contributes to the story (unlike other AC games).

I bought a Gamecube because Resident Evil moved on it. However, I was so shocked to play a game that just totally blew Resident Evil out of the water, and that's no easy task! I think the only 'bad' thing about this game is the fighting system. It's rather dull, nothing really new to add, and nothing stands out. You do get to aim it certain body parts, but that gets old real fast. There is also a very small amount of differant enemies. Though that's not worth taking any points off, because the rest of the game is so amazing that I didn't even notice the only 'decent' fighting system. The game is set across 2000 years, so you get to play as about a dozen differant characters, *a differant character for every chapter!* which keeps the game from getting boring. My favorite thing about Eternal Darkness though, is how frightening it is! Maybe it's just me, but I've never seen a movie or played a game or read a book that was as scary as Eternal Darkness. It isn't the monsters that are scary, it's what you don't see that gives you the chills. Plus there is a lot of shocking things that make you jump, I won't spoil anything though. But this game really keeps you on your toes. It also plays with you, meaning ""you"" as the player of the game. It all has to with the game characters sanity level. Again I don't want to spoil anything, but this game is just to clever! There are so many things that happen in this game that are so disturbing and wonderful at the same time. I'm amazed that anyone could give this game a bad review.

The games graphics for the most part are really good. There are some little things that don't look great, and some of the effects aren't the best, however they are above average and not even worth complaining about.

The control is simple and shouldn't get in your way much. I just hate when your character runs out of breath, much like in Silent Hill.

My favorite part of the game is the sound. You must crank this one! Never before have the ""things that go bump in the night"" made you so nervous. Only thing scarier would be having this sort of thing happen in your own house. The sound programmers really pulled off something great!

This was really an ""impulse buy"" for me. I hadn't planned on getting a game when I bought this one, I am so glad I did though. A great game, buy it! If you don't own a Gamecube, buy  one, and then buy this game. Pick up the Resident Evil remake and you are in for a treat and a half. While I do recomend this game to everyone, those of you *myself included* who are into the supernatural will just eat this up.

Plus, any game that begins with a quote from the Raven is ok by me!",One of the best ever,1032739200,5,,

Yes, you start with the normal story/characters and then once you beat the game (if you get the best ending & beat the memory) you have the option to play as Richard & Maria or as the sisters Loretta & Stella. If you don't save the sisters you will not be able to play as them in a new game and if you don't beat the whip memory to get the full power of the vampire killer whip then you won't have the option to start a new game and play as Richard & Maria.

It's very faithfull to the originals. If you've played any of the others, you'll feel right at home with this one.
What's good:
  After the years of not having a Metroid game come out, fans finally have something to sate their addictions, and this game does that quite well.
  The missions are straight forward. You have a computer named Adam that tells you where to go and what to do. You do it, save the game and get back in touch with Adam. No fuss, no muss. It's all laid out what to do next.
  Graphics are incredible. Especially given the size of the screen.
What's Bad:
  While it's nice to have missions that are straight forward, it nags at me that the game goes so far as to restrict your movement to the level that pertains to your particular mission. You're not AS free to move around as in other Metroid games.

What's Neutral:
  They've completely revamped Samus' look. Of course she's recognisable as Samus, but she's radically altered.  I kinda miss the old costume.
  Some of the old items have merged or changed slightly. Example, Hi-Jump is now a combination of Hi-Jump and Spring-Ball. The differant missles, instead of using one or the other, stack the abilities. You don't just have a regular missile, super missile, or ice missile. You have an ice-super-missle. Small differance, but you'd be surprised what some people would fuss over.

5.0,False,"05 6, 2010",A3AUJU8NVES4EQ,B000SSPH3E,J. Brunner,"I really don't know where to begin with this game. I was always a fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics. This game is essentially that game. There are a few minor plot points and the localization--originally it was patently bad, and now it is actually near FFXII quality, and that is to say its nearly to the point of the best localized game ever--is a vast improvement, but when it comes down to the mechanics its virtually unchanged.

I have always been in the camp that Final Fantasy Tactics got a bum rep from the beginning. It was certainly deserves a lot more credit than it was ever given. Its greatest flaw was probably its release was immediately after Final Fantasy VII and the two games couldn't be more different both in the way it plays and its tone. I know I already complained about its original localization. It was bad, but it wasn't actually wasn't significantly below par for 1997, but that was addressed in War of the Lions, so we needn't revisit.

This game is one of the best Strategy Role Playing Games (SRPGs) ever created. It has a lot of competition, none of which fares particularly well in the US market, but in this case, people are not cheated out of a good introduction to the genre by being suckered into a 'Final Fantasy' (FF) fan. I will admit, as an FF fan, I have bought some pretty awful games--games that had no business being made let alone sold--under the Final Fantasy sticker. For fans of the series, you will also get one of the most in depth job experiences of any of the titles. It has customization that can be at once both simple in style and profound in effect. Players can expect to enjoy finding a balance for each of their characters.

Admittedly there are some oddities with this game. The befuddling obsession with the zodiac creates some bizarre results. Some of your people will just suck, while Cidolfus Orlandeau continues to murder everyone with brutal efficiency. This has always been, for me, a cheap and unfortunate inclusion in the original, and it remains unchanged here... but then you don't have to use him. I personally preferred to hire my own people and to develop them just the way I liked, even if they were not the greatest. Since you basically haul around a platoon of men, women, and beasts, you have a lot of room to customize here too. For people who really love other Final Fantasies, you've got Cloud in there and now Balthier too. Their inclusion seems perhaps a little forced, particularly the latter, but this is really more for people who want to play too much of the game anyway.

The game offers a solid 40 hours of play, probably significantly longer than that. At $.50 per hour, you could hardly ask for a better deal. Graphics are as to be expected; somewhat low in quality considering its a PS1 port, but slightly better than that. The new cut-scenes are just beautiful though. My one complaint or warning is that the game has always been rather above the average US player's difficulty level. Thats not to say its impossible or that we suck as a whole, but its no secret that many games are made a little less challenging when they get shipped over here for a more casual experience (AKA: an experience that is not marked by repeated Game Over screens). You kind of get the sense they didn't bother with this. That was partly true in the original version, and it is definitely true for this revision.

Another neat addition is the online play. Its a little slow, but considering that you're playing a turn based strategy game... what do you expect? You can also reap unique rewards like this, so participation is certainly rewarded.

With all that said, this is easily one of my favorite games ever. I loved the original and this is an improvement. This is what Square needs to be doing with their time. This is what you should be playing on your PSP. Buy it!",More Please!,1273104000,,,

If you have a good sound system turn the lights down and the game will unnerve you as every new part of the space station you enter may mean an attack by monsters that will tear you apart. The graphics are good and the sound effects superb. At the end of a battle it is so intense you often breath a sigh of relief you're still alive (very immersive).

To its credit the action is unpredictable enough to where you're never sure if the noises in the room are just loud machinery, or some creature on the attack. At times I was tense for no reason (empty room) and at others I would relax (all clear?) and get a big surprise! There is a bit of a story too and the level of detail in the art of the space environment is impressive. This kind of game can get repetitive, but they break it up with levels of zero gravity and it really feels like you're floating in space (well done).

The trick to survival in the game is smart use of your environment for cover, your telekinesis to momentarily freeze your attacker, and blasting off the limbs of the monsters so they can't move forward or strike. There is a good selection of weapons so you don't get bored but I stuck with the best three and kept upgrading them. You can set the difficulty up or down any time you like so if a 'boss' is too hard try it on easy mode. I normally don't like boss monster fights but these seemed easy enough once you find their weakness and there's always an online walkthrough if you get stuck.

The first was a success because of the blend of strategy action and historical charcters. The sequel, The Age of Kings, expands on this winning formula, and in doing so, creates the  best real time strategy game avaliable on the market. The game focuses on  13 major empires, such as the Persians, Vikings and Japanese. As head of  one of these 13 kingdoms, you must defeat your enemies to gain rulership  over all the land. This is very fun, being that each race is varried and  has different strengths and weaknesses. It is also fun, because each one  has a different look to them, the Japanese buildings look much different  than the Vikings. The real fun of the game starts when you play the preset  historical scenerios. You take control of such historical figures as Joan  of Arc, Genghis Khan and William Wallace (ie Braveheart). These are all  historically accurate and can help you learn a great deal about the time  period. There also is an excellant multiplayer game, featuring the usual  deathmatch games, as well as a regicide game, which gives each team a king,  and the first one to destory each others king.

5.0,False,"08 16, 2013",A3PDYHA2GC9AW1,B004LLRYOY,Bryan,"Final Fantasy IV is the game that made me fall in love with RPGs back when it was released on the SNES. I've been playing this game for two decades now, and I'm full of nostalgia for every aspect of the original release: from the music to the pace of the gameplay to the characters. You would think that this would make me and others like me the prime target for a release like this, but the reason this game is getting 5 stars is not because of my nostalgia, it's in spite of it.

I have played other releases of this game before. I played the Nintendo DS version in its supposed 3D glory. That's not a 5-star game. It just barely lived up to the name for me. It was serviceable, at best. The sound processor on the DS didn't do the music justice, and the 3D graphics only served to suck the artistry out of the sprites. No, the original sprites weren't beautiful, but people mistake better technology for better appearance. Next-gen consoles of today can do three dimensional polygonal characters that rival the best 2D artistry, but that doesn't mean that all games with 3D look better than 2D games. I'd argue that there's more detail in Final Fantasy VI's 16-bit sprite characters than there is in Final Fantasy VII's polygonal ones, nevermind the pre-rendered backgrounds. The 40-polygon blocky characters were just ugly. It's the same deal with Final Fantasy IV DS versus the PSP version.

With that being said, here is why I consider this to be the ultimate version of Final Fantasy IV:

-The best looking version of the game. Beautiful sprites, spell effects, and movies bring the game to life better than any other release, utilizing a masterful artist to draw the characters without converting the art to a chunky 3D model.

-The additional After Years and Interlude are included in by far their best versions available. Interlude I believe only exists on this release! They're included as separate games, so you can play them if you wish, but don't have to if you don't want to. The original Final Fantasy IV is not affected by them whatsoever. The only other releases were for cell phones or as a Wii download that, in terms of presentation, felt more like fan-made content than a legitimate addition to the series. It now gets its proper due and actually feels like it belongs.

-The translation is slightly better than the SNES version and pretty much on par with other English translations. Some people have claimed that the translation done by the fans was the best, but I've read a guy analyzing the various translations of this game on the Legends of Localization website, and it seems clear that the professional translators did an okay job compared to the amateurs. In any case, I'm putting this as a positive because they stayed the general course with the translation. It's good enough to get the point across without having too many liberties taken.

-The MUSIC! You have a choice between the original music which ACTUALLY sounds like the masterful SNES music, or the new arranged versions, some of which are shockingly better than the originals. I'm so lame that I actually listen to original SNES FFIV music on my iTunes on occasion. Yes, the original music, as it sounded in the game. For me to even suggest that they redid that music to sound better is pretty incredible for even me to believe. The fact that you can still choose to hear the original music is just gravy.

-As with other more recent releases of this game, they have the full skill list for the characters that was taken out of the original SNES version for the US. For example, Edward can ""salve"" the party which lets him use a potion to heal everyone at once. Cecil can use his HP to his all monsters at once as a Dark Knight. These additional skills add a great deal to the early stages of the game, and will be appreciated by RPG fans just playing this for the first time; heck of a lot better than just hitting ""attack"" over and over with no choices.

-I know a lot of people have picked this up and trashed how ""easy"" it is compared to the DS remake, but that's mostly just the first third of the game which has slightly easier bosses. They seem to have decided to allow players to cruise through the early parts of the game without any leveling up. Still, if you want the full challenging experience, you can play with the active battle system fully on, and battle speed set to the fastest. The monsters attack more, and you can have your difficulty if you like. I found the ending of the game to be mostly just as hard as usual. Also, even on easier battle speed settings, the additional content of Interlude and After Years ramps up the difficulty a great deal, so those thirsting for something tough now have it in full force. The additional content offers more challenge than the original ever did. Overall I'm going to say that this is a better compromise of difficulty than most releases of this game, even though I would personally rather the first few bosses weren't toned down. A brand new player to the game might be completely baffled about why anyone said the game was easy as many popular RPGs on the market are not any harder than this.

-The overall presentation and attention to detail. The main menu even has a lot of options with access to artwork and cinematics without playing the game, and we now have a bestiary.

As for negatives, I can think of nothing significant. It is going to annoy some people that you have little control over choosing your party, but I think most RPG fans should be able to accept this given the overall quality of the experience. The main thing new players may find annoying is the random battles, but you can easily run away from most battles if they're bothering you, at very little penalty. There is one thing that needs to be turned on in the settings, which is the option to switch whose turn it is using the triangle button. One reviewer actually has this down as being missing from the game, and it bothered him a lot. It is there, just turn it on and you're all good.

All in all, as a massive fan of FFIV, I can think of no game I'd recommend more highly to a RPG fan than this remake. I've played it through in past versions 10 times before, and I would not hesitate to say that this is the version to get. Fans of this game should be relieved that it finally got the treatment it deserved. At $20 or less as of the time I'm writing this, it's a steal!

5.0,True,"06 3, 2017",A2VVZAZO7924QI,B00Q03M3HY,Gooo_Gooo79,"I am well aware that a general portion of souls fans rank this title last in the series. I will admit that this game stumbled out of the gate upon its original release but I have to say they have worked to retool it for a better experience with Scholar of the First Sin.  In my personal opinion I think the game would actually have more value if Dark Souls had extended beyond a 3 title to like 4 or maybe 5.  I say that because Dark Souls likes to be vague in a way that makes us try to fill in the pieces for explanations to the dealings of the world we are in.  With that point made, I think Dark Souls 2 may seem the most vague in the series as the 1st had the luxury of setting the story and the 3rd on the conclusion.

With the release of Dark Souls 3 and some returning to areas from Dark Souls (1) in it, I feel that isolated Dark Souls 2 more in story.  For some reason it seems like Dark Souls 2 is on some sort of off beaten path not hammering on the central point of either rekindling the flame or not like DS 1 or 3.  Still I think what is needed is time and interacting with all available NPCs to see the effect of the ""fire-linking curse"" on humanity.  I personally got drawn in seeing that it was a old Herald Fire Keeper that drawn us & many like us in a time like vortex to set things right. I get that feeling of near to no hope left as the young Herald Fire Keeper interacts with our player not sure if we will be the one to resolve the dire situation the world is in.  She seems almost hopeless as each player character arriving to her has exhausted her as so many have answered the call but no one has yet succeeded.
  So a lot of people take time writing massive reviews so I don't want to keep you on an unending review. In short for story you will get the most out of it if you explore, read up on items and find all NPC's you can exhausting their dialogue.  Now lets talk about play in general.  I know this may not be the best description of controls but I felt the controls where the most ""tank-like"" for this series then the rest.  Overall I felt my character moved slower compared to my others in the Dark Souls series and blows I threw or took impacted me more noticeably as well.
  I am a little mixed on the humanoid enemy topic but the main take away is that thought has to be taken before engagement and exploration.  Remember we are a weak soul our selves at the start of the game and we must fight our way to the pinnacle.  One thing I can say is this game will knock Pride off so try to never let yourself get over confident.  Just example for me is that I have personally struggled with terrain and have had more deaths from falling or getting knocked off ledges then deaths by enemies.  Also that does make me want to say if I have any major complaint for sure is the fact that you do roll after every jump and if you are not aiming for a wall on a jump, you could be rolling off to your death.
  I like the option to up grade armor besides weapons and personally I like the way magic/miracles/ect are done better here then like in DS 3 with the FP bar.  Don't get me wrong I like the other Dark Souls and 3 is my personal favorite to team with my friends on but DS 2 actually has more content. There are so many more bosses to fight here but I will say I find myself playing mostly alone on DS 2 so in the area of cooperative play I can't give the game a lot of praise.  Most people I run with on souls games finds teaming easier on DS 3 then 2.
  So to sum up the game is challenging in its own right, has many classic RPG elements and loads of content.  With the game being re-polished on PS 4 with all of the DLC content I think it deserves a 5 star.  I suggest checking out videos if for some reason you feel unsure about getting this game to see what you think. Honestly it does feel like a transition game style wise in fighting from DS to DS 3. That comment might sound negative but what game series have you not seen some forms of alteration in gaming mechanics harking all the way back from 8 bit to 16 bit games?

It's hip, it's new and fresh something that's has never bin done before.  Jet Grind is not only a terrific Dreamcast game but it simply one of the best Dreamcast games next to Shenmue and Soul Calibur.  The game is an instant classic that no one with a Dreamcast should miss out on.  The game is extreamly original and a very underrated gem, heck this is better then the Tony Hawk series.  It has a pretty cool story.  You're are the GG's a skate gang that pretty much takes over other groups of skaters turfs and to make matters worse you are being chased by a ruthless cop and his minions(AKA swat teams)and Tanks, Helicopters and so on.  This game unlike the sequal JET SET RADIO FUTURE is more challenging because it has a timer.  The games level desighn just keep getting better and better and the best part about this game is.....THE MUSIC.  This game has the best music next to Metal Gear Solid.  The music will really get you into this game which if really awesome.  The game is also pretty original cause you can spray grafiti on walls, trash cans, windows ect.  And no game has ever pulled this off but this game is Cell shaded and is very well done.  Every character and level is so well desighned that your mouth will be drooling in such amazment.  Put simply...the visuals in this game are amazing.  I'm going to make this short and sweet.

PROS

-This game has extreamly addicitve gameplay

-The cell shading in this game is absolutley amazing~

-Very Original and ten times better then the rest of those Skating games..

-The Characters compared to the enviroment look nothing alike which gives the game some flavor..

-BEST MUSIC EVER!  This game has some really awesome tracks inculding Rob Zombies ""Dragula""

Cons...

-.............Nothing

Overall Jet Grind Radio lives up to my opinion as the best game for the Dreamcast and is highly original very addictive.  It has sweet cell shaded visuals which even put games like Zelda Wind Waker to shame.  The game is a bit of challenge with the Timer and everthing..  Overall Jet Grind Radio screams Originality and awesome....

Final Verdict..  This game truly deserves its

5 out of 5 stars

And I'm sticking to it......Jet Grind Radio is....AMAZING..

I bought this for my PSTV and not only is all the dlc from the PS3 version included for free, but the back of the case makes it sound like one of the post game scenarios is exclusive to the Vita port as well.

Pros:
- Funny and entertaining story
- Wonderful characters
- Tons of content (This is one SRPG that will last you)
- DLC included for free (Unlocked after beating main story, but there's also a code you can find online, to unlock it at the start)
- Good music
- PSTV compatible (No pop-up errors like D3 gets on PSTV. It's great for if you went the budget way to play Vita games like I did)

Cons:
- Slight lag in over crowded item & character world stages (Can be fixed by zooming out)
- Valvatorez has a few overly quiet whispered lines (I mostly fixed this by messing with in game volume settings & using my TV's equalizer)
- Playtime glitch (Will randomly say in your netherworld records that you played 55k+ hours and won't go away if you save post glitch.)","Disgaea 4 is a Funny & Entertaining SRPG, Best Played on Vita.",1503273600,2,,

5.0,False,"10 29, 2008",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B000X1TC0U,Raul G.,"I'm giving Dead Space my vote for 'Sleeper Hit of the Year'. While other games are getting multi-page print ads and television spots Dead Space will likely fly under many gamers radar in anticipation of hyped titles like Resistance 2, Gears of War 2 or Little Big Planet. Make no mistake though, Dead Space is just as worthy of your time as the more well publicized titles.

The plot of Dead Space is vaguely similar to the movie Event Horizon. You are part of a team sent to the Mining Vessel USG Ishimura. The Ishimura is a ""Planet Cracker"" class vessel that travels the cosmos harvesting resources from far off planets and asteroids. Something has gone wrong though and communication was lost with the vessel. You are going in as engineer Issac Clarke, part of a team of personnel sent to investigate exactly what has gone wrong on the Ishimura.

Almost immediately things start going wrong. Through a series of events your team will be separated and it's up to you to help get the ships vital systems back online. You'll be in constant communication throughout the game with the rest of your team through the use of a video conferencing system built into your survival suit.

From the onset of the game gamers will likely notice the fantastic graphics. In fact the first few minutes of the game while docking with the Ishimura you're treated to some of the best visuals on the PS3. The game features no Heads Up Display (HUD) of any kind incorporating vital data into the players survival suit. Your health bar is displayed prominently on the back of your suit. Switching weapons is a quick directional button press and ammo reserves are displayed right on the weapon. Access to your inventory system is quick and efficient and also features a functional map display that can be used while still playing the game. In fact the entire menu system is built to be minimalistic and keep the player engrossed in the game. Having a health bar and a mini-map seems out of date after playing Dead Space.

Another great feature is the inclusion of a directional guide that displays when you press R3. At any point should you become disoriented simply press the guide an you're pointed in the correct direction of travel to your next objective. Given the sheer size and claustrophobic interior of the Ishimura I found myself using the feature often and was glad to have it.

The environment in the game is absolutely spot on. The interior of the ship is grimy and dark much like you'd expect in an actual mine. Machinery onboard the Ishimura is braking down and enemies lie in the many shadows. You'll spend a good portion of the game trying to get the ships vital systems like communications and life sustainment under control. Each area features enough deviation to keep the game fresh though nothing ever felt out of place.

The sound effects and musical score fit the style of the game perfectly. Enemies will jump out at you around every turn or when your guard is let down. The music will jump right along with your heart, thumping as you run for you life from a pack of grotesque alien life forms. This is a game that is meant to be played alone in the dark. Put the kids to bed, turn down the lights and crank the music.

Controls for Dead Space are tight and slightly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. The camera is a 3rd person behind the shoulder camera that is rarely obtrusive or out of place. The only times I found the camera slightly frustrating was when fighting multiple enemies approaching from different angles. It seemed like the camera was a bit slow to move at times, though that may have been because of my panic to escape the enemies at hand.

Speaking of enemies, Dead Space features a good variety of alien life forms that want nothing more than to kill whatever is on board the Ishimura. Dead Space, unlike many shooters doesn't reward the player for a perfectly placed head shot. Instead many enemies continue their attacks even after decapitated. Dead Space encourages the player to rip enemies limb from limb as the primary means of stopping your pursuers. To assist you in that end the game provides you with access to a range of weapons that vary from ""Plasma Cutter"" to a flamethrower. Each and every weapon is insanely brutal, rendering vast amounts of gore from your enemies.

Another great feature of the game is the ability to upgrade your survival suit and weapons. Using power nodes found in the game game and a specialized machine you'll be able to apply these power nodes upgrading everything about your weapons from magazine size, reload speed, and damage. Your suit will garner you more and more protection and access to an expanded inventory as you upgrade it. There are various other aspects that can be upgraded including the abilities ""Stasis"" and ""Kinesis"". These abilities allow you to slow enemies and machinery down and well as grab and interact with both respectively. Both play a vital role in your survival and will likely be used often.

In keeping with the high production value, Dead Space also features full support of Sony's Trophy system. Think of it as an in-game reward for accomplishing tasks of various difficulty.

All in all I highly recommend Dead Space to anyone who is a fan of survival horror games. Though the feint of heart and kids under 17 should probably stay away from this game.",Sleeper Hit of the Year,1225238400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

While playing Lego Batman and Batman 2, I kept wondering why hasn't there been a Lego game that deals with Marvel's heroes, since I grew up with Spidey,Hulk,Fantastic Four more than I did with DC characters(which I also grew up with)

I was ecstatic when I heard this game was coming out, and man it does not disappoint.  The story is fun and what's even cooler, is after you beat the story, you get to explore New York City in Lego form and collect characters and vehicles. You can also visit The Statue Of Liberty(and use Lady Liberty as a Lego character as well) I live in N.Y.C, and Lego seemed to get everything down to a T.

What's also cool, is the huge Lego figures that appear in the game.  What I mean is, characters like Hulk,The Thing,Colossus, Juggernaut all look like how they should look... like huge a$$ Lego figure's that can stomp and wreck havoc faster than the regular figures.

Another cool aspect is, if you use Spidey or Hulk, you can transform into their alter ego's and it's funny seeing Hulk change into Banner and back LOL.

Basically the game is just fun and addictive.  I enjoy using my favorite, Doctor Doom and wrecking havoc everywhere.  There are SO MANY good characters to choose from(hell I am still trying to get them all in). The story is fun, and after you beat the story, you can replay that same mission and use any character you desire.  Fans of Marvel and Lego will NOT want to pass this game up.

The US was fortunate to receive this game since 2D shooters weren't quite as popular in the states as the developers could have hoped.  But thanks to the success of Gradius, Konami decided to take a chance.  It is interesting also to note this is a direct spin off of Gradius.

Like Gradius, the game contains a power up system.  The more powered up the Vic Viper is, the easier the game becomes.  Therefore, once you 'die' the difficulty becomes much greater.

The level design is innovative which a slightly different style and theme for each.  The top down perspective levels were good, but I preferred the design and flow of the side scrolling levels.  Still, so many Japanese shooters from this era were either one style or the other, so it was nice to have this game switch between the styles.

It is a classic game, dated in many ways, but still just as fun as it was when I played it back in the late 80s.  If you have an NES, this is a great addition to the library, and I consider it one of the better titles that were not hugely popular.",Japanese 2D shooter heaven!,1404691200,,,

First off we have the graphics. They are not 3d  accelerated but they are very good and they get the job done.
Next we  have the sound. I'd have to say that it is the best sound in any strategy  game (although Total Annihilation comes close, in music anyway) The music  is very good and fits each race. The terrans have a sort of rousing  war-movie-like tune, the zerg have a wierd-sounding alien like one, and the  protoss music is appropriately mystical.  The sound effects fit the  situation. (Gooshy biological sounding suff for the zerg, mechanical for  the terran, wierd future-tech for the protoss)
Ultimately though, those  are just the bells and whistles.  The game-play is where it's at and that  is where Starcraft truly excels. The biggest innovation here is the truly  different races.  In past games (can you say warcraft 2?), the opposing  forces have the exact same units with different looks.  In Starcraft they  are really UNIQUE. Every side has its strengths and weaknesses and there  are no real equivalent units. Every different match-up, whether it be  protoss-zerg or terran-protoss requires a different strategy. The terrans  are mobile and do well in combined-arms, the protoss are durable, powerful  and expensive, and the zergs are numerous and frail. The single-player game  plays out well with a ten mission campaign for each race.  The campaigns  are played out in a set order (terran,zerg,protoss) Why? So you can follow  the STORY. Yes there is a story and it is very good too unlike most  Real-time strategy games. Once you finish the single player game, then you  can go online to Blizzard's free internet service for some of the best  multiplayer action there is.

Running around shooting zombies ad nauseam, how is that fun? I tried the demo and thought it was OK at best, and I bought it due to peer pressure from a few of my friends. Well I'm gonna have to eat crow and admit how wrong I was, as this game is an absolute BLAST to play!!

This is a multi-player game at heart. Sure you can play single player, but playing online with others is a whole different matter. This is one of the few games where you truly need to work together to accomplish a goal. As the survivors, if you decide to pull a Rambo and go it alone, you will be quickly overwhelmed by the Infected. Moving together, slowly, and covering each other, are the keys to success. Having a good mic and communicating definitely helps too!

However, where I think this game truly shines is in the Versus mode. This is where you play each map taking turns playing as the Infected and then the Survivors. Playing as the Infected is a whole new ballgame because you don't have a lot of health, and no weapons. Each of the Infected has a unique attack, and you have to work together to isolate the Survivors and pin them down one at a time. It's far more strategic, but very rewarding when you use teamwork to take out the heavily armed Survivors and prevent them from escaping.

If you're torn between which version to get, I'd go with the PC (if your computer can handle it). Not only is the mouse/keyboard combo easier to use than the gamepad, but the future potential for user content and mods will add new life to the game in the future. The fact that the game is on Steam also means it will benefit from quick patches by the Valve team, which they've done for all of their past games. The Xbox 360 version is excellent too, but the PC version has more potential to grow.

PS. If you do get the PC version, there is a very serious bug which causes some freezing problems with certain dual-core processors. The game will lock up for a few seconds (with the sound looping) and will do it VERY often, making the game essentially unplayable. Valve is working on a patch (hopefully it will be fixed by the time you read this review). However, you can fix it by disabling the second core on your processor in the game; just go into the console and type in mat_queue_mode 0. This will fix the problem (and won't lower your FPS). Hopefully this helps you if you run into this issue!

I was never really ""raised on Nintendo"" per say, I actually owned a Sega Genesis back when I was a kid instead of a Super Nintendo (not sure why), but I did grow up playing Zelda on the original NES. I swear that game helped me learn how to read back in the day (I was little). It wasn't until my parents got me a Nintendo 64 for Christmas (one of the best memories from my childhood) that I really sunk my teeth into Nintendo. I did own a Gamecube as well and while I did enjoy it, it never quite invoked the same happiness in me that my N64 did. Then came the Wii...

I was originally excited about the original Wii, until I played it. I could never get used to the waggle controls in games, in fact I absolutely hated them. Having to shake the controller around to pick something up in New Super Mario Bros or to perform certain actions in Donkey Kong Country Returns nearly ruined the games for me. It never felt correct. Why the hell do I want to shake a controller around and HOPE it does what it's supposed to instead of pressing a button and instantly having that response and tactile feedback? I felt like I  was one of many who purchased a Wii and then let it gather dust while I instead played my PS3 or PC (pc master race FTW). This and the huge flood of shovelware and lack of quality games that weren't ruined for me by the motion controls left a bad taste in my mouth from Nintendo. I am a HUGE Zelda fan and Skyward Sword to this day is the only Zelda game (except for Zelda II on the NES) that I have not completed. I HATED the motion controls in that game with a passion.

Once the WII U came out I genuinely had no interest at all. After a year or so I kept considering and considering buying one, but I thought for sure I would somehow get ""screwed over"" by Nintendo again. Well I finally took the plunge and made the purchase a few weeks back and truly couldn't be happier. It feels great to be back with Nintendo. To me, this feels like the first ""true"" Nintendo system I've played since the N64. I have already spent many, many hours racing my wife on Mario Kart, playing Super Mario 3D World, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, etc. These games are all a blast and best of all... no motion controls! While I don't feel like the tablet screen on the control does anything really revolutionary it certainly does have it's benefits. As many others have no doubt mentioned off TV play is pretty damn cool. Even the handhelds I own are rarely taken out of the home anyway so to me this is like having a big handheld with great battery life and a pretty decent screen. The speakers on the controller are surprisingly loud and project sound nicely (definitely a smart design). The headphone jack on the controller itself is the coolest thing. It's great when I don't want the sound going through the stereo, I can just plug my Sony studio  monitors directly into the controller and enjoy some great sound.

This new generation of systems has turned out pretty interesting. Last gen I owned everything, with my PS3 having BY FAR more play time on it. I am getting quite sick of Microsoft and Sony's consoles though for a lot of reasons and have slowly moved over into PC Master race territory and I feel like the Wii U is the best companion to a high end gaming pc. You end up being able to play most of the amazing games featured on Sony and Microsofts systems anyway (with far better graphics and framerate) and then you get the benefits of all of Nintendo's amazing franchises. I feel like somewhere along the way console manufacturers have lost sight of what made consoles appealing in the first place. I don't want to spend 30 minutes everything time I don't turn my PS3 on for a couple weeks downloading updates, rebooting, installing, downloading more updates...go to launch the game...oh wait now the game has to be updated. I mean seriously, I realize there are plenty of pro's to this with getting new features, etc, but it can be VERY annoying at times and I feel like I deal with it constantly. Consoles could squeeze more and more out of their hardware back in the day since they didn't have bloated operating systems like a PC would...and now they do anyway! I don't need my console to be a media player, a blu-ray device etc. That's why I own a pc, which does all of this and more 10x better. I truly miss the days of popping a game in a system and just playing and quickly having fun. At this stage in the game Nintendo offers the closest experience to this.

Considering that the Xbox One and PS4 are just now managing to pump out the graphics that PC's have been cable of doing for years I just don't see the appeal. At least with the Wii U Nintendo gets a lot out of the hardware on this system with bright crisp colorful graphics that will age well. I already own many great games and with Super Smash Bros, Bayonetta 2, the next Xenoblade, Zelda, etc coming out there's a lot to look forward to (more so than with the competition IMO).

So anyway, if you felt like me after the Wii it's time to forget the past and give this system a shot. It really offers extremely fun experiences and is an especially great local co-op system to have some fun with your loved ones.

So at least so far in this generation my recommendation is skip the PS4 and Xbox ONE and pick up the WII U instead. Plus while you're at it, build yourself a great gaming pc, hook it up to the TV with an HDMI cable, grab yourself your preferred controller (Xbox One controller is great for PC) and you will barely be missing out on any experiences.",I actually owned a Sega Genesis back when I was a kid instead of a Super Nintendo (not sure why),1408752000,5,,

Some of the review complaints I have seen are valid while many others I feel in my opinion are unfair or just plain do not make sense, from a honest reviewer perspective. I have EVERY other wwe/wwf game ever made since PSOne. I also own all the Gamecube wrestling games. I had in the past played and owned all the N64 wrestling games as all.

Graphic: Slightly better than SvR 2011, fine at PS3 standard...

System: Load time / Save time - a lot faster than previous games. Thumb up for this. Menu screen look great ...however why is only Randy Orton there, plus what happened to WWE 10/11 practice moves at start screen option go???

Gameplay: A lot of people said that the predator engine was a marketing scam from THQ. I am here to state it is different enough to warrant what has been said about the gameplay feeling fresh and new from THQ. However I can still feel a bit of smackdown past engine in here but this predator engine makes everything feel much different for the better overall.

Details: Good job for wrestler movesets, much improved from years past, there is always room for improvement.

Universe Mode: Much better than 2011, once again the little things here is what make the game really shine.

Road to WrestleMania: Fresh air! I do not understand where the complaints are coming from I only see improvements here. I think a lot of the negative reviews here (major websites video gaming sites) come from the fact that the reviews are really not major wwe fans. I think a lot of the reviewers that are clueless in SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT WORLD expect a street fighter or Mortal Kombat mode story which to a wwe fan is ridiculous.

Roster: Best to date with the exception being here comes the pain. Which had a incredible roster still however with the DLC may be better in time.

Online multi-players: New server, much better, a little lag at times, but THQ claims will be fixed in coming days.

Overall: Ok, still the best wrestling game since Here Comes the Pain, honestly I think the best and to me goes down with the greats like dare I say it No Mercy, WCW nwo Revenge etc. I rarely ever make reviews but I just felt I had to make one from a WWE fan and video gamer perspective that has ALL PAST SMACKDOWN GAMES!

5.0,True,"11 5, 2003",A2J3MR64L567OK,B000059O8B,Yossarian,"Fallout Tactics is a great, great game.  I loved Fallout and Fallout 2 (as well as their early predecessor, Wasteland) but I was leery of this game because of reports it lacked the intricate plot of the first few games.  While that is technically true, in the sense that your main character is not necessarily the focal point, the game is just as complex and challenging.  You simply need to recast your focus as leading a squad rather than being an individual.  In the earlier games you could recruit NPCs, in this game, you finally get to run them.  Your main character matters only in the sense that if they die, they game ends.  Otherwise for all practical purposes you have 6+ main characters; you level them up, pick their various stats and perks, and control them.  No longer need you fret that your NPC will randomly start using grenades in a hallway or gun down your other NPCs in an attempt to shoot something beyond them (this can still happen, but it'll be your fault).  This makes Tactics a real draw to me, because now you can develop 6 or more (you can swap characters in and out of your squad at bases, so you can really have as many characters as you want) different characters at the same time, rather than one game at a time with the earlier Fallouts.
The missions are mostly fighting, but not entirely.. there are often NPCs to talk to, items to recover, things and people to protect, and other objectives.  The Fallout games were 75% talking and bartering, 25% fighting, while these are 75% fighting, 25% talking and bartering.  And Tactics is still obviously grounded in the same warped sense of humor as the others; the many random encounters are hilarious, and the comments people make even while fighting can be both grotesque and hilarious at the same time (one raider I shot in the leg to slow down his retreat started stumbling along while mumbling ""...bone so white.."").
Fallout Tactics is probably most accurately described as Post-Apocalypse XCom, because most of the time you're on missions with your squad.  I loved XCom too, but Tactics has better graphics, more interactive environments, a much wider array of skills and equipment, and that scathing sense of humor.  It also has many vehicles you can use in missions and travel around the world map in, including armored Hummers and army tanks.  Here are just some of the many different tactics you can employ:
1)  Make a character crawl on their stomach in Sneak mode past a pair of sentries to put a proximity mine on a bridge to blow up reinforcements when the fight actually starts.
2)  Fire away merrily from inside your speeding hummer, running over anyone who gets in the way.
3)  Target attacks at victims' eyes or legs or other body areas for increased damage or status effects from broken limbs, dropped weapons, etc.
4)  Lob grenades over walls or into doorways while shooting in through windows.
5)  Sneak up on sleeping enemies and use pointy knives or spears to avoid alerting the entire camp.
6)  Dodge from tree to tree in a city park trading fire with people on the roofs, in nearby buildings, or running around in the streets.
7)  Perform combat first aid with field packs and doctor's bags while ducking incoming sniper fire.
8)  Use your Repair skills and tool kits to repair your damage tank or robot PC.
9)  Play as mutants, robots, ghouls, or even deathclaws in addition to humans.

Rock Band 2 is still my favorite because of the way the screen looks and stuff, but Band Hero comes in a close 2nd.  All the games are fun, Guitar Hero has more metal songs than I like and Band Hero is more for the Pop fan because it has tons of songs by Taylor Swift, Hillary Duff, Jackson 5, etc.  I would say Band Hero is the best family version out of all of them just because of the song list and the menus and stuff.  It is in no means just a pop video game because it has some other harder songs on there as well, just not as hard as RB2 and Guitar Hero does.  That is why I like this one the best.  You can also get cool items if you do really good on a song.  I got a 100 percent on the Song 2 by Blur I think and I got a new drum set or something and it had 8 stars instead of 5 and it lit all up.  It was cool.  Overall this is a great game set, and for the price you can get the full set at, this is the best way to go.  The drums have 2 cymbals and 3 drums which is awesome because the Rock Band Drums only have 4 drums no cymbals.  It is also so much cheaper than those versions too, so it is common sense to get this bundle.  And then buy the other games seperate because they will work with these instruments.

5.0,False,"10 16, 2012",AMNFD1Y9HLLGZ,B0050SXLQC,Tierra12,"I am a long time fan of the Resident Evil (RE) game series.  I have been playing this series since  its launch in 1996 on the Playstation.  I own and have played all of the games in the main series:  RE 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Code Veronica and the Remake.  I have also played a number of the side games:  Outbreak , Outbreak File #2, the Umbrella Chronicles, and Operation Raccoon City.  I have been with the RE series for 16 years even when it began to become stale and repetitive beginning with RE3 and majority of the games that followed ( i.e. Outbreak,  Outbreak File #2, 0, and the Remake).  These RE games did nothing to advance the storyline or improve the gameplay and only served to continue the series lack of new ideas and innovations.  All of this changed with the release of RE4 in 2005.

RE 4 provided a brilliant new direction for the series.  RE4 finally moved the story forward.  RE4 introduced precision shooting mechanics, improved the game controls, fixed the inventory system, created a better save system, featured some of the most exciting boss battles in the entire series, had smarter enemy/friendly AI, smooth transitions between cut scenes and game play, introduced the over-the shoulder perspective, and blended action and horror seamlessly.

RE5 for the most part took the if it ain't broke don't fix it approach this meant that this game kept majority of the elements that were introduced in RE4 and only made one significant change and that was adding the co-op feature.  The problem Capcom faced by incorporating the same game play mechanics that were so revolutionary in 2005 in 2009 was that all of the  things that were innovative in RE4 were no longer fresh especially since a lot of  Westerner game developers were churning out so many games that had surpassed all of the things RE4 introduced and RE5 repeated.

Smartly the game developers at Capcom realized that if the RE series was going to survive the massive competition then another evolution had to take place. This brings us to Resident Evil 6 (RE6).  This is the first game in the RE main series that allows characters to do something as basic as being able to walk and shoot, reload and walk, sprint, roll, slide, and perform melee attacks without waiting to be prompted to do so.  This may not sound like much since this is the most basic sort of character movements found in most games, but for the RE series these movements are both revolutionary and a welcome change.

RE6 features an improved inventory system when compared to previous installments of the series.  It is now much easier to mix herbs and use healing items than it was in previous RE games.  It's also easier to tell how much ammo you have  which is useful information to have during areas with heavy enemies and boss fights.

In order to make RE6 even better the game developers took a look at a bad trend in modern gaming.  This trend they looked at was the short single player campaigns a lot of modern games have since a lot of developers spend most of their time developing the multiplayer campaigns and as a result neglect the single player campaigns.  Resident Evil 6 addressed this horrible trend by featuring 4 campaigns that can be played in single player mode each ranging in length from 7 to 9 hours giving gamers more game for their buck.

RE6 made changes most will appreciate regarding the co-op.  In the single player mode your partner has unlimited ammo.  Gamers will not have to fight over healing items either since your co-op partner doesn't need health items; this is a good thing -- now gamers will not have to worry about their AI controlled partner burning through ammo or health items.  Also if  you are injured you can now maneuver (shoot, roll, and crawl) out of harm's way unlike in RE5 where you had to try to slow walk away from enemies until your partner healed you since you couldn't shoot or do much else outside of hoping the enemies wouldn't kill you before your partner healed you.

In addition, RE 6 offers a great deal of replay value as well.  Players can play 3 of the 4 campaigns as Leon Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller, or their partners (Sherry Birkin, Helena Harper, and Piers Nivans).  Playing as ""the partner"" offers a refreshing way to the play the game since the partners have different things that they'll have to do.  The partners also have different abilities.  These things together offer both a strong and new game play experience.

Long time RE fans may be pleased to see the return of Sherry Birkin (the defenseless, 12-year old girl introduced in RE2) especially since so many die-hard RE fans have speculated about her fate for years.  Now she's back as a capable adult DSO agent who is partnered with Albert Wesker's illegitimate son Jake Muller this makes for an intriguing partnership especially since Sherry's father (William) and Jake's father (Wesker) were close friends and rivals who worked for the Umbrella Corporation.  William and Wesker are also some of the series most popular/memorable antagonist so it's nice to see their children working together and leaving making their mark on the series.

RE 6 also places the most popular male characters Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy in the same game which is something most fans have wanted to see happen for years.  Even though the two men have 2 separate campaigns and  don't work together in  a single campaign which is slightly disappointing  their stories are intertwined in a meaningful way.  It is also just a great pleasure to have the 2 as main characters in the same game.

In closing I highly recommend RE6 for RE fans, zombie fans, 3rd person shooter fans, and action/adventure game fans.  There's definitely something for every gamer in this group.",The next phase in the evolution of the Resident Evil series,1350345600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is a severely good party game and the good thing is that mastering the special moves does not make you ber powerful, the beginning button-masher can get a few lucky wins in which means everyone can enjoy it. But it does reward studying the moves list and I'm sure the next time we get together we will be doing the fatalities/heroic brutalities on each other.

The action is way over the top (Major props to ""Test Your Might"" and ""Freefall Kombat"" to be match-changers, and the hilarity of stuffing an attempted ""Klose Kombat""). Often someone was able to come back from a deficit, which was of course exciting/rewarding. I'm a little disappointed that the old-school bloodiness of the fatalities in the earlier MK games has been toned down but I understand that living in a DC Universe means nobody's truly evil...

I enjoyed the combo breaker/rage mechanic which meant that if you were getting completely slammed you still had a trick or 2 up your sleeve to turn the tables.

The game is very detailed, each character has a very noticeable personality and moves a certain way; visible damage on the uniform after you lose a round.

People complain about the ""cheapness"" of the Flash (wow is he fun to watch!) but he doesn't actually hit very hard so a few well-timed blocks/combos/breakers with a stronger character will take care of him. We tried a large number of the available characters to see if there were any balance issues and the only thing we noticed is that the characters with bladed weapons (baraka/deathstroke) seemed a bit overpowered with their blades out... but maybe we just didn't like to block. ;)

The Joker's tricks and moves are absolutely hilarious and had me rolling on the floor the first time they were executed successfully. ""Put 'er there!!!""  Plus that little silly dance/giggle he does.

If you ever played any Mortal Kombat, most of the old school combos are still there like Liu Kang's fireballs/flying kick and Scorpion's harpoon so if you are just getting back into console gaming like me, your old muscle memory will serve you well.

This is sort of what happens in this game, and also a possible preview for future, more sophisticated DS games.

You are able to draw pacman (I love giving him a Simpsons look with an overbite)and then see your drawing come to life and start carpet munching.  You then control the direction by drawing lines.  The goal is to complete several stages that make up a chapter and beat your previous higher score.  There are 12 chapters in all.

My only nitpicks is personally I felt like there was a big difficulty spike from the first remake to this one. It's a strategy jrpg I know, but overclocked just seemed a lot easier at the beginning and got progressively harder where as this one doesn't give you time to breath sometimes. I mean I believe it's only the first or second day and your already facing demons with 200+ hp that take the fatal blows for their leaders (killing a leader is a fast way of winning a battle) so as you can see this can be a problem. It doesn't help that you don't get any multi targeting spells to mow down all three enemies or at least two of them. In Devil Survivor Overclocked you had access to multi targeting spells early on and didn't have to deal with overwhelming odds, but like I said, it's only a nitpick and it can be done (even though level grinding can sometimes not even make a difference, this is rightfully called a strategy jrpg, because if you go in without any planning you're pretty much going to die. Another nitpick which isn't necessarily bad, but in some of the main missions, the odds become even more overwhelming, example: you need to navigate through the area and issue an action command at a specific area while fighting a bunch of demons that over time simultaneously respawn over and over...seriously how messed up would it be if you spent one hour through hell trying to finish the objective only to get overwhelmed, not because you're not stronger, not because you didn't level grind enough, but because you either don't have enough demons,don't have the right demons,ran out of HP or MP...see this is where the strategy comes in...a lot more this time around believe me. Voice acting is done nicely, no complaints here and I call out voice acting when I feel it's awkward so take my word for it I'm not bias. Last nitpick, the story and it's beginning, in all honesty, it took me a while for it to grip me in, unlike the first devil survivor where the setting and atmosphere immediately had you in suspense and wonder...not sure, this just took a bit of time to get the ball rolling but trust me it is definitely worth the wait, you'll want to stick around.

5.0,False,"09 27, 2011",A36UKFV79879MD,B00002SVES,BX Lounger,"Donkey Kong was originally an arcade game in the early '80s that Nintendo put out to gain exposure. It turned out to be a hit with gamers and it was soon ported to and was one of the launch titles for the NES in 1985. Nearly ten years later, Nintendo released the sequel to the hit '80s arcade game for the Game Boy. Simply titled ""Donkey Kong"", it was a runaway smash for Nintendo as it was a puzzle platform game with the original 4 levels from the arcade game plus 96 brand new levels exclusively made for it. It sold millions of copies and is a fun game that will take you hours and hours to complete.

Donkey Kong sticks to the same story as in the arcade game: You control Mario who must navigate a maze avoiding traps and enemies in order to reach Pauline and rescue her from Donkey Kong. After you clear the original 4 levels, Donkey Kong kidnaps Pauline again and you chase after him through multiple worlds each with its own theme and levels. Now the main goal is to find a key in each level and use it to unlock the exit. To update the game and keep things fresh, Mario can use new moves, weapons and items to take out the enemies. He can even use ladders and flip switches to gain access to other areas of the levels. Once you finish a level or use all your lives, you are prompted to save your progress so you don't have to start over once you turn the game off.

The PROS: This was a proper way to make a sequel to an arcade game that helped put Nintendo's name out there. Everything in the game worked and every aspect of it complimented each other. Playing through 100 different levels was impressive and it never felt repetitive. The new features that were never in the arcade game helped kept the game fresh even though the goal was always the same. On top of that, Donkey Kong was one of the first game to take advantage of the Super Game Boy peripheral that Nintendo released for the SNES (it played all original Game Boy games.) It did that by coming with additional colors and an exclusive border screen when you used the Super Game Boy to play the game and it looked fantastic.

The CONS: None.

Nintendo would continue to release similar games on their other portable systems as it proved to be successful with critics and gamers alike. If you like puzzle games and/or are a fan of the original arcade game, you had to pick this up. If you haven't played it, it is worth searching for a copy so do it as soon as possible.",The sequel to the hit '80s arcade game,1317081600,,,

5.0,False,"08 9, 2011",A1P478YKNZYVXE,B002DC8GM2,GC,"Despite being nearly two years old, NHL 2K10 is still the best hockey game on the PlayStation 3 and here's why...

1)This game easily has the best presentation and commentary ever on the PS3. The broadcast presentations and effects really feel like you're watching a top level production team broadcast the game over the airwaves. It's certainly as good as the Versus/NBC quality in real life. On the other hand, NHL 10 and 11 by EA seemed dead in comparison. The commentators parrot the same lines every year, literally, and there's no practical way to review the highlights of each game.

2)More ways to score. 2K10 allows scoring off rebounds, breakaways and one timers as well as broken plays and lucky bounces. NHL 10 and 11 are purely formulaic scoring games. Do X, Y and Z, you'll score every single time. This just kills the replay value. However with this game, you really don't know how you're going to score before the puck drops. The time tested ideas of crashing the net and the other things I mentioned above still work, but the game forces you to be more creative and the result is more fun to me.

3)Customizable settings. I have to admit that the default settings for this game stunk, everything felt wrong. However as soon as I changed the sliders, it was a quick return to the game I knew and loved in year's past. I essentially turn speed burst off and bump speed/acceleration up to around 70. EA has never really bothered to offer this on the PS3. They figure you'll like what they give you.

4)Interaction. Even two years later, you can download roster updates and game fixes through the game itself, without ever having to use an annoying flash drive. This feature is called ""2K Share"" and works brilliantly. You can even upload your own game files, etc for others to use.

5)The skating is far better than NHL 10 or 11. The players often feel like they're really skating instead of jogging through sand. It's really noticeable when you execute a full crossover with your player. In this game, you feel it and know what you're doing, not so with the other guy's game.

6)The franchise mode allows you to simulate far faster. One season took me an hour plus on NHL 10 or 11 but only takes 10 or so minutes with 2K10.

7)The puck is realistic, it doesn't whiz and bang all over the place like it's a pinball. The player contact animations are better too. You don't get thrown across the ice every time you get bumped.

Now there are some cons to this game, but they fall short of being significant enough to make me stop playing. Let's investigate further...

1)There's occasionally a half second or so delay when you attempt to shoot or get knocked down. It can be a hassle at times because you may miss a critical chance due to the half second you just lost. This happens with NHL 10 and 11 as well but not as often.

2)The graphics are a letdown. The overview of the ice and crowd is fine but the player's faces and crowd detail is simply awful. EA is way better in this department. Get it fixed.

3)No AHL etc licenses and a lack of minor league players as a result. This really hurts depth in the franchise mode. EA snatched up the exclusive license, so 2K wasn't really directly at fault here.

4)Passing is overly simplistic. Every pass seems to go the same speed and is difficult to aim between players. The manual passing in NHL 11 is too difficult/complex but this method is too easy and basic.

5)No Be-A-Pro game mode. This is something I would really miss but if I want it, I can pop in NHL 10 or 11. The franchise mode is usually plenty to keep me busy though.

All in all, 2K10 feels like a much more organic game of hockey and is every bit as good in franchise mode as it's main rival. With an upgrade on graphics and a few small improvements here and there, this game would be the runaway winner in the PS3 hockey war. It's certainly worth $15 used.","An Excellent Hockey Game- Take That, EA Sports!",1312848000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I held off buying a classic controller for the simple fact that Virtual Console games using it could also use Gamecube controllers. I had my trusty Wavebird, so it's not like I'd have to deal with being tethered to the console (oh, the horror!) :)

Then it happened; Castelvania IV was released for download. It didn't take long to realize I needed something that hearkened back to the feel and control layout of the SNES.

The problem comes from the fact that older games were designed without the thought of analog control, and it shows when you try and use it and the direction pad on Gamecube controllers just isn't located in a good enough spot to use either.

For NES and TG16 games I just hold the Wiimote on its side, which works well enough. This can work alright for Genesis games too, unless you need to use three buttons, in which case the 'A' button is used. Ten minutes of ""Toe Jam & Earl"" and you'll realize you need something different. You could try a Gamecube controller, but my argument placed for SNES games carries over.

Considering the prices of the Wiimote and Nunchuck, a Classic Controller really isn't too bad of a buy. It connects to a Wiimote, so you're still wireless.

It should also be noted that the creator of Super Smash Brothers has hinted that the Wii version will NOT use the Wiimote and will be optimized for the Classic Controller.",When the Wavebird just won't do,1167955200,14,,

The offical sacred forum on the developers site is pretty full of debate on what is ""best build""... a good sign.
The game world as stated by many people is huge.  I mean really huge. You can walk (or ride) across it without loading screens etc. Very nice. Saving games is also approx 5 seconds long.
Many main and subquests to complete. Subquests are fairly easy to complete, main quests are often lenghty affairs across good distances. Some of the subquests are broken to some degree with the little subquest arrow not working right. I suspect this will all be patched at some point.  The game is massive, so not surprising some of the wee bells and whistles don't work. The developers have shown excellent follow up on patch issus so far, which bodes well.
Hundreds of items, plus many can be socketed with jewelry and runes, and there are at least a hundred of these to play with as well. Lots of combinations for outfitting your character.
Simple to use, yet deep to think about, special combat arts, spells and combo system. Also leveling up requires thoughtfull application of stats and skills.
Many people complain about difficulty with clicking on monsters to attack etc. ""I have to click 4-5 times to attack a monster"" sort of stuff. The game works best by clicking and holding the left mouse button down. Once doing that your character will continue to attack without constant clicking. (Nice for my carpal tunnel issues!)

I know that last sentence seems over the top, but I don't give praise like that lightly, so take it as the true endorsement it is.  As a role-playing game Fallout 3 offers you a great deal of choice; who do you want to side with, what type of person is your character, how do you advance your abilities--all these and more are left to you.  The story writing is excellent and there is an incredible amount of attention give even in the minutiae.  You might find a remote home on the map with no connection to any quest or story in the game that still has a developed NPC (non-player character) who offers humor, sadness, or greater insight into the world of the game.  Another strength of this game is the open-world design.  While I am not always a fan of open-world games, this one, being set in Washington, DC, keeps things feeling fresh and interesting because of the richness of the locale.  DC has such a wealth of famous landmarks, government buildings, military bases, and subway tunnels that you really feel like you are in post-apocalyptic America.  The attention to detail with the Metro (subway) system in particular was downright eerie.  On top of all of this the gameplay itself was fun and satisfying; there is the usual assortment of weapons, armor, companions, and abilities to keep things interesting.

There are, of course, some flaws.  You will likely, at some point, find or do something that makes the game crash.  Likewise, as the game is now older, you may have to tweak it to make it work correctly.  But it will be completely worth it.

Overall this is a phenomenal game that you can easily, even with just playing the core stories, spend over a hundred hours playing.

Although the Dark below introduced my favorite Raid, Crota, many of the tweaks to the game's economy made activities a grind. The Vanguard and Crucible commendations and the full reset of upgraded exotic wweapons are included on this list of bad features. Thankfully, a lot of the grindy elements of the game have been tweaked or removed.

You still have to put a lot of time into this game for the rewards, but it's more varied than before. The recently added activities like the Prison of Elders arena horde mode, the VIP Wolf Targets and the Targets that prowl the world in set locations vary the game play so my weekly checklist of things to do in the game is less like a job and generally varied enough to keep things fresh when I log onto the game.

Pros:
1. Vanguard and Crucible commendations are gone.
2. The speaker can convert radiant shards and energy.
3. Higher powered weapons that peak at 365.
4. Maximum light level increased to 34, which makes the Crota Raid easier, but still fun.
5. More events occur in the open world, making it more fun to just roam around and engage enemies.
6. With the change in the economy, buying materials like helium filaments from the crucible quartermaster is a more viable strategy.
7. The wolf story missions are pretty fun even if the maps they occur on are not all brand new.
8. Prison of Elders can be a blast to play with the right 3 people.
9. Upgrading your exotics with ethereal light does not reset all of its activated perks

Cons:
1. This is still Destiny, so if you didn't like playing the game before, this expansion pack will not change your mind.
2. This game needs dedication to unlock all of it's rewards. For some, like myself, this is a plus.

I've played them all though at some point and love them all. Who picks sides? What Ghosts is is pretty much a different game altogether. If I feel like playing the best Battlefield, I'll play BF4 (even though it takes time finding a decent server sometimes) and I'll love it. If I feel like playing the best CoD game, I'll play Black Ops 2. But Ghosts is a combination of the two to me. It feels like Battlefield at times yet doesn't stop feeling like a CoD game. The maps are bigger and there are places for campers.. But that's the thing, I like that challenge in these maps. Black Ops 2 was smaller and didn't quite make you feel like camping. It made you constantly on the move and that's pretty much the feel of the series that was lacking in this game which in turn enraged many gamers that wanted to 'replace their old copy' so to speak. Battlefield 4 is huge but sometimes you'll run for a whole minute and get pegged by a sniper or deal with campy flag holders. In CoD Ghosts you get campy flag holders as well but it never feels like a huge setup for nothing. The maps are bigger but not VAST and you can react quickly or accordingly without wasting your whole match figuring out the snipers strategy. You have time to change your approach through trial and error without spending too much time doing so. Same goes for Free4All. This doesn't feel completely like a CoD or Battlefield game. It's a whole new game. And I like that. It felt like the first time I played Blacklight Retribution on PS4. I don't feel like I was replacing an old best title like I did with the jump from Bad Company 2 to BF4 when I got into Ghosts. I'll still play BO2 from time to time because it's the best CoD game in my opinion. But Ghosts is new and it almost feels like a hybrid of Battlefield's BC2 and CoD's BO2.

5.0,False,"01 11, 2003",A1OZZV3HJTHX3H,B000066TS4,Riomaki,"Mega Man Zero is, simply put, one of the best Mega Man games to come out in years.  With a fresh, new look, fun gameplay, and extremely crisp animation, I'm anxiously hoping they will make a sequel!
Mega Man Zero takes place in the year 22XX, presumably within a century after the X series ended.  It stars Zero, an android, who was Mega Man X's comrade in arms back then.  Zero was reactivated by a human scientist, named Ciel, who needed his legendary powers to defeat a new threat.  That threat comes in the form of Neo Arcadia, an oppressive government regime that has ordered the destruction of all Reploids, worker androids based X and Zero.  The identity of the mysterious leader of Neo Arcadia provides a very surprising and fascinating plot twist for those who have followed the X series.
The gameplay is fast and furious.  If you ever played as Zero in the X games, you'll have a general idea of what to except.  Zero is equipped with a gun and a sword to begin with, although you will find the latter far more useful.  Eventually two other weapons can be earned and each of them can be joined with the Elemental powers won by defeating the bosses.  The game controls perfectly and Zero's animations are incredibly smooth, even when compared to the PSX games.  They really nailed the graphics in this game.  The music and sound is less memorable.
The game is hampered by a couple negative points worthy of mention.
First, the game presents you with the Cyber Elf system.  Through this system, you can upgrade Zero, give him energy tanks, and in general make the game a lot easier.  The problem with this system is that to use Cyber Elves, you not only have to find them in the levels, but also gather up enough energy for them to reach their full potential.  With some taking upwards of 1200 points, you'll find yourself standing in the Underground Lab stage hitting those spider robots for hours.  This is just bad design.  If a player wants the item granted by the Cyber Elf, it is already at their option to use it or not.  If they want to use it, don't put this artifical hurdle in their way.  If they want an item bad enough, they are going to sit there and gather the energy to do it, so why not just let them have it?
The second point is the difficulty.  The game has a slightly wacky difficulty level in that it is harder in the beginning than it is towards the end.  That's because when you use the aforementioned Cyber Elf system, you will gain items that make things a lot easier.  Until then, the first two or three bosses are going to be very difficult.  Indeed, the whole concept of giving Zero one life to get through a level and limited continues is just harsh and will easily frustrate the casual gamer.  In the future, Capcom should bring back the original lives and unlimited continues premise.  At least, after you beat it, you can start over again with all of your weapons and upgrades.  The bosses, once you have the means of defeating them, are a joy to fight again, mostly because they are so original in both design and attack strategy.
Even with these problems, Mega Man Zero is still an awesome game.  Capcom really outdid themselves with this one, creating a game that easily rivals the past two Playstation Mega Man titles.  If you are looking for a fine Game Boy Advance game you won't defeat in a couple hours, try this one.  I would recommend this to side-scroller fans and especially those who are looking for another game like it after having beaten Metroid Fusion for the fourth time.",Best Megaman Game in Years,1042243200,8,,

The Movies is more about producing movies and making money. You can make movies, but you do not have complete freedom. Instead, you have a ton of sets, and like 100 different scenes for every set that you can put actors into. This actually works out pretty well as you can create a ton of different interesting scenes in interesting ways by using tiny pre-built scenes. If you don't want to create movies, you can have script writers do it. There are seemingly billions of movies they can write. I get eager to see what kind of movie they are making when I see interesting titles and such.

You create stars, cast the movie, then shoot it. During the shoot  you can alter the screenwriter's movies slightly. Or, you can let the director shoot it himself and manage your huge studio lot. You unlock more stuff as you progress, and every 5 years there are awards. The awards are hard to get, and I get excited whenever I see my name nominated.

As you progress, your stars start to want things, and eventually they become big. It's really awesome to see one of my stars become such a huge success after doing so many crappy movies. You can give your star plastic surgery and treat him like royalty by giving him an entourage. It works out pretty well, but the only downside to this is that sometimes other stars might get jealous.

There is even an online feature where you can post movies and earn more game stuff.

I heard about this ""game"" from a friend so I decided to try it out. I have to say, so far, I'm impressed! I like The Biggest Loser Challenge for a variety of reasons. First, you can make up your own routines. I like to kickbox so I created a kickbox routine with activities I like to do. You can also work specifically on core, arms/chest, legs, and so on. I also like this workout because you feel like you're on the show. There are challenges and even weigh ins! You get to vote someone off too, which I thought was kind of funny. Also, you can adjust how long you want to workout for. If I only feel like doing 20 minutes one day, that's fine. There are also week-programs so you can start with a mild program or go for one that's longer.

The only downside to this workout is sometimes the Wii remote doesn't pick up my movements. I'll be doing the exercise exactly, but the remote won't score me ""points"". I don't worry about it too much though because I know I'm doing the exercise, even if it's not shown on the screen.

And just a warning: you need to wear pants/shorts with pockets! haha They have you put the remote in your pocket for some workouts so if you don't have pockets, you might not score correctly (although I've worked out with no pockets, and it can still kind of work).

I will never understand why this game has recieved some mediocre reviews. The only problem I see with this game is its graphics. Nobody is going to like this game just for its graphics. In my opinion the very first pokemon RPGs had better graphics than this game, for one simple reason: In those games the pokemon characters could be seen as large, cute images. In this game you will never see your stars any way other than as small (but well drawn and well animated) sprites.

Everything else about this game just seems wonderful to me. One very good thing is that this game can be played absolutely at any speed you want to. The game has features to run through dungeons very quickly, but it will always let you stop and think things out, and believe me, by the time you save the world you will have had some scenarios come up where you'll want to think out the best course of action.

By the time you save the world in this game you will have played 25 hours and will have witnessed one of the most charming stories in any video game. But the game hasn't even hit its stride yet. I only play extras after the story is finished in games if I really like the game and feel compelled to, and oh yeah I wanted to see what this game had to offer! Many of the game's features don't even appear until after the storyline is complete. Don't misunderstand, saying ""the storyline is complete"" in fact is not true, because really nice scenes long after the storyline resolve things that never really finish in the main storyline (the first 25 hours).

Once you've played 80 or 90 hours your heroes will be extremely strong, and none of the ordinary dungeons will be any challenge for you. BUT, this game includes two wonderful features (neither of them making any logical sense but that's alright) that will keep the challenge up even after that. The first is missions where you have to escort a weak pokemon deep into a dungeon. If your client gets beaten it is just as bad for your team as if your heroes are beaten. The bigger and better challenge-increasing feature is the three dungeons where your characters lose all their advantages (level and special abilities) every time they enter. Don't worry, they'll get all their levels back after they leave the dungeon. These ""level 1 dungeons"" are a really special challenge the likes of which I have only seen in Lufia games.

And I haven't even mentioned some of this game's coolest features. If you know someone else with the game, or have internet access, you can have your defeated team saved by someone else and have another chance at the dungeon. That feature's so neat I hope other games pick up on it and add it to their series. And hey, this is a Pokemon game, with - get this - 413 varieties of pokemon that can join your cause! Well, 28 of those are different Unowns so there are really only 386 recruitable species, but still it's impressive. After completing the story you can return to earlier dungeons with tough legendary-pokemon bosses like Zapdos and recruit them. And some of the non-legendary pokemon, like Chansey, are even harder to recruit than the legendaries. Another neat feature is that it IS possible to steal items from shops in the game, but you REALLY have to know what you're doing not to be beaten (without the chance to even be rescued). If you're dedicated and lucky enough to recruit the shopkeeper, you'll have a decided advantage in those level 1 dungeons I mentioned before.

If you only play till the end of the main story, this game has 25 hours of gameplay. But I think it's a safe bet you'll want to play more than that. If you play long enough to complete all the dungeons it'll take a little over 100 hours. That's pretty good for an RPG, BUT, if you really like this game and want to recruit every single pokemon, and want to get into the internet friend-rescuing scene, this game has 400 hours of play!!! That's amazing. I've logged 425 hours, and I still want to play more. And the graphics only bothered me about the first one-fourth of an hour.","Don't expect a traditional pokemon game, but this game is wonderful!",1169856000,24,,

What I love about these games are, kids can have so much fun with them but an adult can also have a go too. Some of the task may be a little easy for an adult but some may not be (especially if you're going for gold).

If you haven't played any of the Cooking Mama games, then the style of the game is a little something like this, your goal is to plant something, such as a tulip but its broken down into  stages, seeding, digging a hole, and so on.

I know everyone else loves the racing of the Burnout series, and surely this is some of the best racing on any platform. However, for me, the absolute best thing about the Burnout series is the crash mode. INCREDIBLE! It is hard to put into words why it is so much fun to drive as fast as you possibly can into a crowded intersection to see just how much monetary destruction you can cause. It's like primordial fun. Your inner beast gets to come out in the form of plowing through semi trucks cars and minivans. Plus, every time you complete a crash intersection, you unlock another. Each crash is different, each intersection is different. Eventually you'll get to harder to crash intersections and the crash mode becomes somewhat of an addicting puzzler, trying to figure out how to get the gold. Each crash intersection takes about 1 minute to complete lending this mode of the game to the perfect portable title.

Bottom Line: Is it fun? Yes. If you like completely destroying cars and you don't mind using a little brainpower to do it, or if you just want the best racer anywhere, get this game. Will I keep it?

* Edges of cabinet are not beveled.  would have made the stick a tad more comfortable. (Edit: Rounded so not sharp but just not beveled like the pro stick.)
* Sliding panel to cover the start button.  Awesome feature that prevents inadvertent press during play.  Just remember to flip that lid down.

5.0,False,"06 25, 2002",A2MESGKKDC5E9X,B00005R5Q0,Mark Williams,"Fifa 2002.  This game is better than any words can describe.  It combines high quality control with incredibly realistic graphics for an excellent feel.  Being a soccer fanatic, I can tell you that this game is much like the real game of soccer (except that it requires no real physical play, of course).  I have been playing this game non-stop for a couple of weeks now, and I have had this game since Christmas.  It is great for multiplayer or for just sitting down by you for a quick game.  I like to challenge myself by playing on World Class mode, the hardest level of play there is.  I'll get right into the game.
I'll start with the graphics.  These graphics are absolutely incredible, no doubt.  Every time I turn the game on my jaw drops at the incredible detail of the players' faces and the scarily accurate interactions between players (arms pushing off each other, legs reaching out to take the ball, etc.).  And the cinematic sequences, like every time you score a goal or the opening, ending, and halftime sequences, are beyond belief.  EA Sports is known for having the tip-top graphics, and this game goes far beyond my expectations, and I think many people will agree.  The presentation is good, and even the Menus have been carefully thought out.  The game is aesthetically pleasing, and all of my family members agree that this is one of the most realistic-looking and playing soccer games on the market.
Next, the sound.  The sounds are very high quality in this game, and even the menu music sounds good.  I find myself getting these songs stuck in my head often (which is not always a good thing).  The commentary is incredible; every single part of the game is programmed in with commentary, and there is an option to turn it off it you don't like the announcers.  Much of what they say is different, and I find the announcers' reactions to be very amusing sometimes.  There's not a whole lot to say about the sound effects, they are fairly simple.  There's not much to them except for the thump of the ball being kicked, and the occasional moan from a slide-tackled player.  They are fairly simple, but are extremely effective.  And an occasional burst from the crowd can actually affect the way you play.
The gameplay.  Wow, what can I say?  It is incredible.  Unlike any soccer game I've played before (and believe me, I've played a lot), this game's control is nearly perfect, and the use of momentum and curve on the balls now has a big effect on your game.  It's all these tiny things that make this game feel real.  There is now an easy way to do a 1-2 pass (give and go), and that is with the flick of the C-Stick.  Lob balls are also important, and they can be kicked by using the B button.  However, one of the most important additions to your shots and passes is adding curve to the ball.  I have scored numerous goals from nearly midfield by adding curve to the ball so that it curves around the keeper and into the net.  You can also curve the ball around players for all sorts of passes.  This game is extremely fun to play, and I enjoy it nearly every day.  Seasons are especially fun for me, and the Create-a-Player option is also enjoyable.  Overall, the gameplay is excellent.
The replay value for this game is excellent in my opinion, but many people do not enjoy sports games as much as I do.  I find I can play this game several times in a row and I am still perfectly satisfied.  Keep in mind though that this is my opinion, and my opinion could differ greatly from someone who doesn't like sports games.  Also keep in mind that another improved version of this game is Fifa World Cup.  I have yet to play this one, but I've heard it's great and can provide more longevity to your Fifa experience.
Overall, Fifa 2002 is one of the greatest sports games currently.  I enjoy it a whole lot, and I feel that everyone should at least try this great game.  It's at least a must-rent, and I believe it's a must-buy.  All of the qualities that make up this game are nearly perfect, and a season only takes up 29 blocks on a memory card, which really isn't bad as far as seasons go.  Overall, Fifa 2002 is a great buy and I recommend it to any gamer that enjoys sports games.  As an avid soccer player, this game is great fun for me and all of my friends.  I hope this review is helpful.

As such, it works very well, although some liberties on the music may hinder the enjoyment of this Play Set those who had watched the movie.

This play set starts the adventure with a movie from the First Order Star Destroyer.  The movie drops us in Jakku were the game actually starts.  So as with other Star Wars Play sets, this one also changes the story for the sake of game play and loses some of the surprises from the movie.  It also removes most scenes that earned the film a PG-13 rating.  This last part is good, because you want to be able to play this play set with your kid or just for fun.

The character are stylized versions of these Star Wars characters, a similar to Clone Wars animation, but a bit softer on the edges.  You get a lot of the usual missions, fetch me something or attack my enemy but with the Star Wars flavoring. Missions are marked yellow, blue and purple. Yellow mission are critical to move the plot line. You get to do a lot of exploration if you want and play some fun mini games; a 2-D x-wing vs TIE fighter like old times video games is rather enjoyable.  Of course, you can eventually proceed with the story that takes you from Yakku, to Takodana to Star Killer Base.

Unfortunately, this play set plays very fast.  I got through the main story in less than 16 hours, and I spent a lot of time exploring and solving side quests.  This is to be expected as the story only covers one movie.  There are a few artistic choices that may not bother kids and those who have not watch the movie, but it bothers me a bit.  The main one is the music choice for Kylo Ren.  Also, there are some characters that don't quite behave like in the movie (I'm looking at you Han) and others than don't show up at all  (where is Maz?).  So if you watched the movie, set your expectations level low and you are going to have a blast.  Because as with the movie, the main draw on this play set are the main characters.

Star Wars Characters
The Star Wars Figures included in the Star Wars The Force Awakens are:  Rey and Finn.

Rey
The sculpt of this figure is very good. She's posed on a ready stance with her signature stance.  Her paint is mostly flawless, with expressive eyes and clothes painted on matted cream colors. She stands on paved stone surface with some green moss. Her main attack (press Triangle button in PS3) consist of a series of swings with her staff. Her ranged attack (press R2 button in PS3) consist of firing her blaster.  Rey is a melee character and can get very good with her staff.

Finn
The sculpt of this figure is also very good. He is posed on a ready with his blaster rifle at hand. His paint is mostly flawless, with large and expressive eyes. He also stands on paved stone surface. His main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series of punch and kicks. His ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of firing his blaster.  Finn is a ranged character and can get very good with his blaster rifle.

If you have read or are familiar with the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Divine-Comedy-Inferno-Purgatorio-Paradiso/dp/1449557848/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso</a>, You'll know Inferno is about the author's decent through Hell.  When I read it, the book sent a tremendous array of mental imagery that scared and amazed me at the same time.  At the time I was thinking, ""This would make an excellent setting for a video game.""  Well, EA and company delivered on that plane.  While the game is by no means a faithful recreation of the book, it delivers an experience that can only really be summarized as a kindred spirit to the book.  Each world has such depth and creativity with amazingly unique creatures from circle to circle.  Scantily clad demons populate Lust, while ever hungry worms populate Gluttony.  The realms are beautifully repulsive.  Yes, I used that and I will again........beautifully repulsive.  But enough about the visuals.......they're great.  Moving on.

The gameplay itself is in typical hack-n-slash formula.  Wielding Death's scythe, you can unleash some very fluid combos and tacking on some magic makes the battles erupt.  However, don't expect alot of it more than hitting square and triangle alot.  To break this up, puzzles are thrown in from time to time to flex your mind as well as choosing to absolve or punish the denizens of Hell's circles.  That's right, mid-combat, if you are feeling lucky and generous, you can choose to absolve the creatures you are fighting; as well as choosing the fates of some historical and mythological characters from history.  Case in point, early in the game you approach Pontius Pilate.  Do you forgive him?  Do you punish him?  Your call.  And making that call factors in to which side you receive ""exp. points"" for.  Which brings me to the skill tree.  You have the Holy and Unholy sides.  Holy focuses mostly on magic, Unholy on melee.  The souls you collect are redeemed to beef Dante up.  Pretty standard if you have played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine-Uncaged-Edition/dp/B001PKHRUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged Edition</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Force-Unleashed/dp/B000R39GPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</a>&nbsp;or any other button mashing games in the last few years.

The sound of the game is amazingly brutal.  You hear the screams of the tormented, the wails and pleas of the damned.  Hell(no pun intended), it makes you FEEL the despair and anguish.  It could quite possibly, in much the same way the book did, scare the Hell out of you(okay....that one WAS intended).

However, the real ""God of War Moments"" are the bosses.  There is so much wow factor to them that it makes Wolverine's boss fights seem like reruns of Andy Griffith.  Expect alot of button prompts and figuring out plans of attack.  These are the fights where simply pressing square or triangle will not yield the best results.  I would love to go in to a lot more detail, but frankly take my word that they are amazing fights and don't make me ruin it for you.

Ultimately there isn't really alot to this game that has not been seen before.  Yet somehow, it SEEMS fresh.  More importantly, it is still fun.  I doubt there will be a changing of the guard on the realm of Hack-n-Slash champions, but this game is certainly up there and should be taken very seriously.  With God of War III supposedly being the end of the franchise, Dante's Inferno may shape up to be the next in line.  With graphics, gameplay, and sound that dares you to turn away........a Dante's Inferno franchise could be golden.  Seriously, pick this up.  If you can't afford it.....rent it.

You gotta love the great console wars of the early 1990's. They truly gave birth to some epic moments in gaming. For those out there like myself who grew up playing Sega Genesis games at home and have a weakspot for nostalgic blasts from the past, this collection is a Godsend. There isn't much to say about this collection that hasn't already been said in great detail, but I felt it to be a worthy endeavor to add my voice to the legion that is Sega fans.

What you get when you pay for this collection is essentially 40 Sega Genesis classics, as well as 9 extra bonus games you can unlock, some of which are arcade titles and others of which are Sega Master System games. Most of these games really are timeless classics too: Sonic 1-Knuckles, Ristar, Shining Force 1 and 2, Phantasy Star 2-4 (and the Sega Master system version of 1), Vectorman, Ecco the Dolphin, Dynamite Heady, Comix Zone, Golden Axe 1-3, I mean the list goes on and on. The games here range from serious smash hit titles to very obscure, lesser known gems that should have been hits. It's a great collection that will offer hours and hours of nostalgic fun and truly memorable experiences. There's also a large variety of games here, taken from all sorts of genres that were prevalent at the time.

The Genesis was a system with fantastically unique hardware. I mean, the music alone is magic in electronic form, truly. Obviously, the graphics have aged and some better than others, but like a fine wine, most have aged quite well and that adds to their charm. What's even more amazing is just how timeless the gameplay is in most of these gaming darlings. To be honest, I'm quite stunned at just how much most of these games have retained their ""freshness."" Granted, most games are over two decades old, but still, these games play way better than I expected them to. That could be attributed to the stupendous work done to port these games onto the disc. The games have been worked on so that they output in HD. Now, the graphics aren't better, but the colors are definitely very vibrant and you don't have the infamous SD lines going across the screen. Beautiful, colorful games like Ristar never looked so good. The controls also work very well on the 360 controller too. Sega and Backbone Entertainment did a very good job making sure these games play and control exceptionally well. Bravo!

Also worth mentioning is the fact that there are quite a few extras you can unlock. There are nine additional games that are quite easy to unlock. These range from arcade games that eventually became Genesis titles, such as Altered Beast, as well as some famous Sega series that started on the Sega Master System, such as the first Phantasy Star. That was really nice to see on here. There is also a gallery of sorts on the disc, where you can view nice little advertising/marketing pictures of each game, as well as neat, informative fun-facts about each game and its history. There are also bonus things such as interviews that give insight into that time period in Sega's history. All of these are really nice extras for Sega scholars out there. Overally, Sega really went all-out to give one of their shining achievements the treatment it deserves, and I really respect that.

The very first video games I ever played as a child were on the Genesis my family had at home. I grew up with a healthy diet of awesome Sega treats. Now, all these years later I have my own home with my own family, and to play these titles on my 360 at home really packs a nostalgic punch in the heart. I have such a soft spot for those old classics. My wife, on the other hand, grew up with a SNES at home instead and was blessed with all of the truly magical titles that graced Nintendo's awesome 16-bit counterpart to the Genesis. Even she, who has never really known Sega's quality first-hand until now, has loved becoming acquainted with it with me from this collection. Two very different experiences, same great opinion of this collection. That's just awesome.

This disc was truly a divine gift. To top it all off, this collection is a mere $20 these days, sometimes less. That's less than 50 cents a game! To contrast this, Phantasy Star IV was nearly $100 at launch, so this collection is seriously a fantastic value! I really can't recommend this collection enough, whether you're a gamer who was significantly impacted by this sweet system of blast processing, or you're a gamerly scholar who is interested in a genuinely thrilling and fascinating pocket of video gaming history, this is a great purchase.

It is based on a real Persian military group called the Hashashins. They focused on political control, sending commandos to infiltrate a target's household staff, etc. in order to make things go the way they wanted.

But this game is about carrying out objectives in a totally free, open world. I am blown way by the combination of stunning graphics and huge maps. The cities of Damascus and Jerusalem are beautifully rendered and a blast to explore. Almost any building or wall can be climbed, any person can be killed, you can go anywhere you want. There are investigative objectives before each target's assassination (eavesdropping, pickpocketing, interrogation, etc). In addition, there are flags to collect (200 total), towers to climb (to reveal the map further), citizens to save from brutal soldiers (they help you later).

I'll admit, I am an accountant in my 30's, and NOT a hardcore gamer. I got this game for it's historical context (I have an interest in the Medieval period and the Feudal era in Japan). I can be turned off by complex controls and button combinations. While the objectives are challenging, I found this game is easy to control. Both character movement and camera can be controlled with smooth accuracy.

Interestingly, the Knights Templar are your enemies. So you're on the Scaracen side. 60 Templars around the map for you to find and take out. They are really just a side quest, as there are several main assassination missions. After each assassination, you get better weapons and new techniques become available(4 main weapons: long sword, short sword, hidden/sleeve blade, throwing knives). This is good because the guards and soldiers in Jerusalem and Acre are noticeably tougher than the ones in Damascus.

There are several approaches to just about anything you want to do. I started out fighting like Dynasty Warriors - on the ground in the middle of 5 soldiers - and they promptly sliced me up. Then I started learning to run up a wall to the roofs, and hack or knock them off as they climbed one by one up the ladder. Or I would sneak up behind one, stick my ""hidden blade"" in his throat, then quietly walk away before his buddies notice him slumping to the ground. Riding a horse appears more realistic than any game I've ever seen. The horse trotting and the character movements (especially when climbing) are amazingly real. Simply scaling a tower or doing a swan dive off the top into a haystack is enjoyable. (Hiding in hay or rooftop gardens for a few moments gets the heat off you if soldiers are looking for you.) After the 2nd mission, you gain the ability to perform a lethal counter-attack and do running, leaping assassinations with the hidden blade. Now that is a blast! Every guard in the vicinity is after you if you pull one of those!

I also started out fighting the guards around towers I needed to climb and kept getting killed. Then I figured out how to lure them away while riding a horse, then gallop back and climb quickly before they caught up. I tried running past them and climbing, but they throw rocks and knock me off. Now I am down to stealthfully assassinating each one just for fun. This is much harder to pull off around Jerusalem where the soldiers are much more alert and much tougher to fight.

Anyway, it's a very cool, medieval era, virtual world to play in. You should give it a try!","Amazing graphics, huge world, awesome controls!",1239753600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Here are my viewpoints.

1. Best space shooter I've played in years and years.

2. Awesome atmosphere, graphics, sound, story, voice-acting, mechanics, etc. Explosions are great and the weapons are powerful and uniquely varied enough to make a difference.

3. Easy to play basically with just the mouse and number keys (for weapon selection)and a couple of other keys. Very responsive. Multiple flying speeds with intuitive mouse wheel control. ""C"" key changes view from behind, cockpit, larger perspective.

4. Unlimited ammo for regular auto guns. Limited but sufficient quantities of secondary weapon ammo. Good balance.

5. Large quantity of destructable buildings, spacecraft, and objects all with fabulous demise.

6. Missions provide variety and challenge(especially latter ones).

7. Took me about 20 hours to complete. Needed to replay some missions over several times until I determined the best strategy/tactics/weapons/flying speed.

8. Great surround stereo sound with external speakers and I/O Magic Sound Assault 5.1 Surround Sound headphones ($67)

9. Tremendous quality product in all regards for a modest and more than fair price.

10. No auto save but you can save at any spot in the game. When you complete a mission be sure to manually save or you may lose your progress point. Plenty of free ""save slots.""

11. Didn't have any software glitches, slow-downs, clipping, etc. Seems to be well tested, polished, refined....at least on my computer with its configuration. The minimum specs for the game imply a moderate configuration.

Some areas you may or may not like:

1. Repetitive complimentary comments from fellow flyers on successful enemy hits. ""Right between the Eyes"", ""New Ace"", etc.

2. Some repetitive mission objective declarations & cutscenes during intense mission combat. Sometimes distracts from the flow and concentration. A few presented impatiently with haughty voice.

3. Minimal opportunities to ""warm-up"" to the characters involved. A few jokes and some conversation but they are ""fighters"" not ""socialites.""

Overall, I would recommend this software highly for a great ""Space and Shooter"" romp. It may be difficult to find except through Amazon and the publisher since it unfortunately hasn't received much publicity. Gamespot.com and IGN.com both gave it favorable reviews and stimulated me to purchase. I'm glad I did.

5.0,False,"03 12, 2014",A2478EE85ECO73,B00DB9JYFY,C. Ramos,"There's been a sad trend in multiplayer FPSs lately. It seems that games like Call of Duty and Battlefield have taken a page from the Apple playbook and decided they could maximize profits by playing it safe and offering customers more of what they're used to with minor updates to provide incentive. That's not necessarily a terrible thing in every case (look at Madden for instance, same thing every year with a new coat of paint), but it is for the shooter genre which has infinitely more creative potential. That being said, Titanfall is a breath of fresh air for myself and many other fans of the genre. It's a bold new take in a market that's been stagnant for too long. And though it does have it's faults, it has more than enough strengths to tip the balance in it's favor.

I've decided to focus on the NEW features of the game for this review, since basically everyone is familiar with the core elements of an FPS (aim down sights, put bullets into things that aren't you until those things are dead).

[Titans]:
These 30 ft. tall mechs are the real stars of the show in this game and after playing it, it's easy to see why. The Titan gameplay is definitely a refreshing and somewhat relieving change of pace for an online multiplayer shooter. Some have wondered why the addition of Titans in an FPS is a ""gamechanger"" for the genre. Here are the 3 biggest reasons.

1). Durability
Playing as a Titan is in stark contrast to the COD/BF formula, where your soldier feels about as fragile as tissue paper against your opponents. In a Titan you no longer have to worry about ""campers"", ""spawnkilling"", ""noobtubers"", C4 or even lag! There are really no cheap deaths with Titans and everyone gets a fair chance to live for more than 10 seconds.

2). Survivability (is that a word?)
Titans are also different compared to vehicles in other games, like Battlefield, because Titans don't explode instantly when they're finished and they can also eject players. Basically that equates to being able to survive a vehicular destruction and continue playing on the same life. In most shooters with vehicles if the vehicle goes down, it's taking you with it. Or even if you manage to hop out at the last second, what are the chances that whatever destroyed your vehicle isn't going to blow you up as well? Thank you eject button!

3). Customization
Pretty self explanatory, but it's still a first. In BF or Halo you simply find stock versions of vehicles scattered around the map. Now you can tweak these walking tanks to your liking in a variety of different ways to suit your playing style.

[Bot Reinforcements]:
This is something that may need some tweaking to reach it's full potential. Bots, or ""grunts"" and ""spectres"" as they're called in-game, populate much of the battlefield in Titanfall. They do a surprisingly solid job at creating a full scale war illusion. It takes a humble 6 vs 6 scenario and turns it into a massive conflict. They definitely bring something to the table, but for the most part they behave like they haven't really decided what they're supposed to do with they're gun yet. At times you'll encounter them and they'll simply stare for a moment before shooting you with what must be a pellet gun, because it awkwardly takes it's time sweet time to kill you. They can be dangerous in groups, but that's pretty much it. It's bad enough to make you feel embarassed when one kills you. But it's still plenty of fun to take them down. Everyone loves a free kill, and these guys practicaly gift wrap it for you. Perhaps they deliberately went for the brain-dead behavior so little kids or your golden retriever can take pride in the fact that they made something dead.

[Multiplayer Campaign]:
This is where the game falls short the most, but since this is a multiplayer ONLY game, it's hard to really be too disappointed about it. Even after playing through the campaign with both factions, you'll most likely have no idea what the story was about. There's simply too much going on in-game to pay attention to the talking heads that pop up intermittently. If they wanted to present a story, they should have done it in cutscenes, not while a Pilot is riding your Titan like Seabiscuit trying send it to robot heaven.

[Burn Cards]:
Burn cards are little bonus perks that are one life use only. You get them frequently, but you can only use 3 per match. Truth be told, they just seem very unnecessary and slightly unbalance an otherwise pretty well balanced game. For example, some of these cards will straight up give you an enhanced version of a gun that does more damage. That doesn't quite feel like an even playing field, but there are probably many who would disagree. However, there are also cards like Double XP that feel perfectly fine. So it's obviously a mixed bag here.

[Jetpack]:
You can finally double jump in a FPS... and it's beautiful. No, but seriously, it makes getting around so much easier and it's a lot of fun. Don't know why this is the first FPS to do this, platformers have been doing this for decades.

[Parkour]:
Overall, the parkour elements of wall running and wall jumping are pretty hit or miss. It's not that these moves don't work, it's just that there are numerous times where it can feel a bit clumsy and imprecise, resulting in maneuvers that can only be described as a fail.

Pros:
+Titans
+Mentally Challenged Bots
+Jetpack/Double Jump
+Vehicle Customization

Cons: (All Very Minor)
-Story Campaign
-Burn Cards
-Occasionally Clumsy Parkour

Everything is bigger and better in this game - the number of puzzles, the amount of skill (or luck) required in conquering all of the levels, the excitement of forging your way to Big Kahuna status - heck, even the exotic fish you unlock as you advance through the levels are bigger than before.  I initially worried that the new ""chain reaction"" aspect of the game would take away some of the challenge, but I was wrong.  Sure, it can be a lot easier to maneuver your way out of a jam with the help of different types of bombs, but the addition of those explosive pieces also allows for new kinds of puzzles you won't find in the first game - and those bombs are of little use to you if you can't maneuver them down to where you really need them.

Big Kahuna Reef 2 is broken up in to three different sections.  The Kahuna Quest consists of one hundred puzzles of gradually increasing difficulty - nothing that should really bog you down.  Once you solve all of these puzzles, the other two sections of the game are unlocked.  The Tiki Challenge consists of 36 different puzzles, the last dozen or so of which can prove somewhat daunting; I'm still trying to finish the last of these, but I'm determined to beat it or die trying.  Rounding out the trio of sections is Other Adventures, featuring no less than 600 puzzles created by players of the game from all over the world.  If that's not enough, even more levels can be downloaded online.  We're talking untold hours of fun and exciting game play here, making Big Kahuna Reef 2 well worth the minimal cost of purchase.  I'm just hoping there will be a Big Kahuna Reef 3 out there waiting for me whenever I manage to finish the hundreds of puzzles in this one.",Hours of challenging fun await you in Big Kahuna Reef 2,1266796800,2,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

Because of this, there are monotonous stretches of the games that look and play far worse than the great set piece locations.

One example of this is the underwater level, it doesn't even look like you are underwater.  They used a simple post process system to tint the screen blue, then they added fish and other undersea life but because it doesn't have the murkiness or realistic particles you would expect in other underwater levels.  Another notable example of poor game design is the interior of the Hatter's Domain, the art direction gets thrown out the window for around 45 minutes and each room uses the same basic textures, models, etc... and in the Hatter's domain there are major collision problems and some key objects have really simplified collisions so it looks like alice is floating.
Despite these flaws, the story, soundtrack, art design, and core gameplay can easily make up for these drawbacks.  If the game were shorter and more refined it would be more enjoyable but the mere promise of seeing another beautifully designed environment will carry anyone who appreciates Alice's excellent design through the experience.","Not flawless, but easily one of my favorite games of the year.",1310601600,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

And I'm not showing any signs of slowing down or desiring to end my subscription. My first impressions are still lasting, but SE does everything right by adding new content with patches often. Often enough that you may feel overwhelmed if you don't stay on top of progression raiding or the story. However it all comes together when you have the time to explore and devote to all the various end-game activities or tasks.
Since writing my original review, I have built a new computer that handles the game quite well. Many of the initial issues with combat is less troublesome and lag does not seem to be an issue any more. While the game will run on most machines, I personally recommend having something within the past 2 years in order to have a better experience.
Speaking of experiences... ARR's community has got to be one of the most inviting and enjoyable experience I have ever had in any MMO. There's something to be said about meeting someone while crafting, have a random conversation, and then that player recognizing you as you do a random dungeon later on in the week. I get the sense community and reputation as I have been remembered by people I've come across and they say ""Hi, remember me from <place>?"". The players are helpful and understanding when it comes to someone who is new to dungeons/raids. This of course may vary from servers... but in my first hand experience, I've befriended so many people from just running around and exploring. It's nice to have people you look forward to running into again in the game.
So ARR's first expansion is rapidly approaching around the corner. Many are excited for the new Jobs as well as the new race. If you haven't tried ARR, I highly recommend it. You may not be able to get everything accomplished before Heavensward... but it's good to start now.

ORIGINAL: Firstly, I didn't get this through amazon. Steam was running a 50% off sale last month on the standard and CE versions. I grabbed the standard so as to play and try it during the first free month at least. After the 1st month, I went a head and became a subscriber.

The subscription process, while can be tedious for some at figuring out, is easy once you have it set. Also two subscription tiers is quite nice. 12.99/mo for one character/realm(server) up to 8 characters. Or 14.99 for more than one per server, up to 40 total. After playing the 1 month free, I couldn't fathom having more than one character. At least not on the same server as the original. Some people may disagree, but the fact that you can do every class/profession on one character alone, there wouldn't be much need to make another unless to be a storage character.

So by now there's plenty of reviews to read through to get the idea whether to get the game or not or whether you would enjoy it even. This is more of my take on it. As with many others who play FFXIV:ARR, I too have been a long time FF fan. Though there have been flops in their franchise, however I still look forward to the next installment of their games and ever evolving worlds SE manages to create. FFXIV when it first came out was a huge disappointment. After a day of beta testing, I had given up with the game. While I did not end up buying the retail 1.0, I read similar opinions to mine about the finished product. But it has certainly been redeemed as of today. The game is amazingly fun and engaging. The community is friendly and helpful (on server that I play). 2.2 is being installed right now and adds whole new content for players who are at end game, as well as some things to look forward to as someone who is still leveling. It certainly is a breath of fresh air after playing WoW for nearly 10 years. In this month and half, I have not even considered going back.

A few notes that make this review not a stellar 5/5. Combat is repetitive. I have tried all the classes out, and have advanced to 2 jobs of PLD and WAR. This seems to be the constant flaw with all MMOs, that combat is very repetitive use of the same skills and smashing the same keys over and over. Doing other things or trying other classes helps break the monotony of combat, but at some point you'll want to go back to swinging swords and axes. I've noted the same about the THM class, it's very repetitive strokes of the same keys in the same order for every encounter. There's not any ""talent trees"" that allows you to deviate or completely customize your skills to be used, you get the same spells as the next THM. Also there isn't any resistances that I can tell, making spamming of fire and or ice do the same amount of dmg across the spectrum of enemies you encounter. That's one gripe I have about the DoM classes.
The only other bone I have with the game is more along the fact that my comp is 6 or so years old now and is falling behind in specs. The game runs well on my old system, and I could only imagine would run smoother on something newer. (That I may remedy soon) But there are times where starting and stopping running seems to slow everything down. And it takes your character a brief moment to get momentum again. It may just be my lacking system, but it can be annoying while fighting bosses and trying to get out of AOE attacks, and while on screen you look to have dodged it, in actuality, you are hit.

Other than this, the game shines where it once was passed off as one of the worse MMOs ever to hit shelves. GOOD JOB SE! Keep it up!",A refreshing new MMO,1395792000,3,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

I love being able to go fast, tearing up the track, and I love that when (not if) I wreck, I can almost feel the pain of it.  MotorStorm: Pacific Rift does all these things, and then some.

From World War 2 era bunkers and airfield, to a lava overrun beach town, to an abandoned mountaintop observatory.  The elements play havoc to your vehicle as well.  Bikes and smaller vehicles will has a harder time negotiated the mud and dense brush but can make up time with there acceleration, while big rigs and Monster trucks can tackle pretty much any terrain and take abuse, but sacrifice speed over durability.  Also, water and fire have an effect on the boost gauge of your chosen ride.  get to close to fire and lava the boost will heat up faster, making an engine explosion more eminent, while driving through water will cool your boost down, but might hurt your speed.

Not every version has improved on the previous with Double Dash, a surprisingly soulless experience following on the heals of the groundbreaking Mario Kart 64, being a notable letdown. Unsurprisingly, no later games employed Double Dash's innovation of multiple Kart riders. The big innovation this time is magnetic wheels which allow karts to ride sideways on tracks or up entirely vertical inclines, even upside down and I have no doubt this advancement is here the stay because it works brilliantly. Gliders have also returned and continue to add a nice new dimension.

Mario Kart 8 absolutely has the feel of a next generation game. It fills the screen with vibrant colors and frenetic activity. For years I drooled over the graphics of the arcade versions of Mario Kart and with MK8 the graphics now meet or exceed anything in the arcade. The game is perfectly at home on a modern 50+ inch HD TV. In fact I occasionally enjoy watching other people play just to see the graphical details I'm missing while racing. I'm not one of those people who complains about lack of innovation in video games if a series continues to improve significantly and with just a single entry per platform Mario Kart is able to show huge, noticeable graphical improvements and of course we get 16 brand new tracks as well as 16 classic tracks entirely updated. Along with the improvements Nintendo keeps the mechanics consistent and the 8th entry feels perfect. With all the hours and hours of play on previous games I'm able to pick up and go right out of the gate. In fact I've pretty much been killing it in the Grand Prix and I've beaten most of the staff ghosts. MK8 now features a new 200cc Grand Prix which is a serious challenge and will hone your skills to a greater level than ever if you can manage to stay on the track.

One of the coolest track innovations is Mount Wario which is one downward run down a mountain rather than laps. I'm really not sure where the series goes from here. The graphics have achieved the level I've always dreamed of and the control is perfect. Mount Wario may be a portent of the future with more continuous tracks or maybe tracks can be linked together to form more of an open world experience. Whatever the case, any improvement will only polish a near flawless gem and I'm very excited about the future.",The Best Kart Game Yet,1451174400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

First, they're comfortable. Very comfortable. I had them on for a 5 hour Fortnite session with my son and they never became noticeable in a bad way.
The wireless signal never dropped or became weak, it was as if I was wearing a wired set.
The audio...wow. The audio is amazing and the presets are simple but effective - normal, bass boost, and treble boost. All have their own uses depending on the game or music you're playing. But the sound was crystal clear and made me very happy indeed.
The controls are easy to use as they consist of big buttons built into the cups. Just push to change the presets, or to mute the mic. There are also knobs on the outside of the cups for game and chat volumes which can be set separately from one another.
They're metal and leather, and feel super durable and solid. Not like my old plastic Turtle Beach sets that felt like a child's toy (and broke just as easily).

5.0,False,"12 10, 2010",A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B002BSA3EM,PT Cruiser,"Wii Fit Plus, that is! I couldn't wait to try this because I enjoy the other Wii games so much and find it's a great way to get some exercise without leaving your living room. I also thought the balance games would be fun and maybe help me be a little more graceful.  I actually do find myself being more aware of balance after playing with it for a while.

There are lots of nice new features with this Wii Fit Plus. I always wished I could set up routines instead of having to move from one menu to the next after each exercise, or that there were ready made routines that I could follow involving several exercises. With the Plus this is possible. You start in the locker room and select from Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, or the Favorites menu. You go to another screen to decide what parts of your body or what type of goals you want to pursue and the difficulty level and length of time. Then the system will set up a routine designed just for you and your goals. I think it's much more efficient to go through exercises this way. You can also compare how you did each day and how much you're improving. There's a multiplayer mode so that more than one person can play, but you do have to take turns. Still, it's nice to not have to 'log out' each time a different person wants to play.

Another new feature is that you can add babies or pets to the Plus. I have a big fat long haired 'mini' dachshund that was too embarrassed to be weighed today, but that pupper is going to get weighed tomorrow! They don't get to do body tests or play any games, but you can keep track of their weight and record it in their stats. Useful? Well, maybe not so much but big points for the cuteness factor.

I love the games because it's such a great way to get exercise without even realizing it and the 15 new ones in this title are just as good as the old if not better than the first edition. Want to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time? One of these games will have you balancing on a big red and white striped ball (your Wii Fit board) while juggling smaller balls thrown to you by your assistants. Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music? Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails. It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge. I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to ""pop"" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole. You control their movement by leaning in different directions on the balance board.

There are also 3 new yoga activities and 3 new strength training activities. That's not to say that some of the games don't improve strength and muscles. There is one game where you flap your arms like wings to fly from one target post to another over water to get points on each one. This is one where you want to draw all the curtains because you'll look completely ridiculous standing there on your balance board wildly flapping your arms like some kind of a crazy bird. But you won't believe how tired your arm muscles feel afterward and you don't even notice while you're busy flying from one target to another. There's another game, Island Cycling, where you step on the balance board to simulate pedaling a bike, trying to pass Wii flags where you accumulate points. You steer with the Wiimote held sideways. I was surprised how sore my calves were afterward, trying to control the speed of the bike.

When you can get exercise while doing something that's challenging and fun without even realizing that you're exercising, that's a successful game. That's why I bought the Wii to begin with and this game takes full advantage of the balance board and all the interactive features. Can I walk and chew gum at the same time after playing these games? Well, maybe not yet but I can bust big blue and white balloons by running into them with my Segway on a beach and get almost halfway through the course inside a big ol' bubble in Balance Bubble Plus.

Any fan would also remember what came after that. 3D Cell Shaded graphics with a funny little child link running around a cartoonish world. Some liked the change in direction, some hated it. The thing that both can agree on though is that the game was innovative and fun while staying true to the core nature of a Zelda title. Phantom Hourglass is the continuation of this story and Nintendo is showing it's fans that they can take the title to smaller hardware, throw in new ideas and gameplay and still keep true to the series and the original title.

Being one who just recently finished playing my copy of Twlight Princess, I found it to be quite the change to go back to the cartoon'ish appearance. Not to say it was a negetive change, I felt it a refreshing change to see brighter colors again. The colors weren't the only changes I was seeing as well. The controls where different as well and they are amazing. They are extremely responsive and well thought out. I am able to set the DS on a table and play it with merely one hand if I wish to and it still works out with little to no issues. The one problem with the controls I do have is it is sometimes hard to make Link roll when you want him to. This in no way shape or form ruins any of the gameplay though.

I'll be breif with this. The story is up to par with other Zelda titles. The controls and graphics are just the best you can find on the system and the sound is classic Zelda reborn.

Graphics (10/10): This is one of, if not THE best looking game on the Genesis. There's LOTS of detail in the graphics in every stage, and the vibrant colors really draw you in. One of the most impressive things about this game is how infrequently it slows down. Unless you engage in some fairly heavy action, you won't ever see this game move slow.

Sounds / Music (10/10): The soundtrack to this game is damn near perfect. The music by Norio Hanzawa provides the perfect atmosphere for each stage the game takes place in, and is an amazing show of how good the Genesis can sound when put in the right hands. Probably my favorite track is ""Empire - The Final Assault"". The song plays during your such to save your sister Yellow, and it has such an epic feel to it that you can't help but be wow'd.

Gameplay / Control (10/10): This game plays like a dream, especially in two player mode. Like pretty much all Treasure games, this one has a gimmick to it. The gimmick in this game is that you can choose two out of four weapons right away. You can use these weapons individually, or you can combine the weapons available for up to 16 different combinations. Some of these are good while some are not so great. Probably the two best are the Double Flamethrower and the Lightning Chaser. The power-up system, despite being a gimmick, is quite a cool one that really adds to the gameplay.

Be prepared when you play this game though: Even on the normal difficulty, this game can be extremely challenging. Fortunately, the good folks at Treasure decided to give you unlimited continues no matter what difficulty. Even still, this game is far from a breeze. It really helps to bring a friend along. Oh yeah, as if this game wasn't awesome enough, it's two-player simultaneous!

Overall (10/10): This is one of those rare games that is just absolutely brilliant in every conceivable way. You can really tell in every little detail that the people at Treasure put their hearts and souls into making this game, and in my opinion, it's the best game on the system and is definitely worth the price.",Can't do this on Nintendo,1456099200,,{'Platform:': ' Sega Genesis'},

But for those who like a game that combines the fun of Sly with the weapon-blasting of SOCOM but without the dark undertones of the Jak series, there is Ratchet & Clank.  So far the unlikely duo of a weasel-like hero (Ratchet) and his small yet reliable partner in heroism (Clank) have had gamers running and gunning through 2 hits (the original and R&C: Going Commando).  So since Sly, SOCOM and Jak have released sequels, would R&C follow suit?  DUUHHHH!!!!

Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (if you can't laugh at this title, get some help) finds our two heroes enjoying the success of their last mission (Going Commando) with Clank becoming a TV superstar and Ratchet becoming the second banana.  Suddenly a request comes in for the two to jump back into action when a race of creatures called the Tyrrahnoids attack Rachet's home world of Veldin.

However, when they learn that the attack is the work of a mad scientist named Dr. Nefarious, they also learn that there was only one person who faced Nefarious before and beat him.  Unfortunately for R&C, it turns out to be their old friend/nemesis Captain Quark, who they faced in Going Commando.  Realizing that they need Quark to stop Nefarious again, they go on a search to find him and stop the Tyrrahnoid threat.

Once again, you get to play with some serious sweet (and fun) weaponry through the game, including a gun that turns your enemies into...ducks (thus taking the phrase ""Duck Hunt"" to a whole new level...hee hee) As you progress, you work on building up both your personal experience to gain health and also stepping up your arsenal (no pun intended) by consistantly using your weapons to add upgrades that will come in handily in later missions.  Also, just a small piece of advice: if you still have your old game data from both of the previous R&C games, have it ready since it can help you get a discount on weapons in UYA.

Needless to say there are some definitely funny moments throughout the game, including when you find out where some of the Sewer Crystals came from...it isn't pretty...:)

JTAG ... RGH ... Hard Drive & DVD Flashing ... Homebrew ... X-Clamp Mod ... Watercooling ... Etc.  I love putting my soldering skills to the test and modding hardware!  I know the PS3 doesn't really offer that but the hard drive upgrade ability is a cool feature without having to flash a HDDSS.bin to firmware and being limited to certain HD sizes.  Not a big fan of the PS3 dash layout ( I also hate the new Xbox dash too ) but I guess I'll get use to it.  Love the fact that online gaming is free, store layout, and buying games is much easier.  Not being able to fully install the games to the hard drive sucks which is what I really like about the Xbox 360.  The controllers feel a little weird for FPS but great for fighting games that use the D-Pad!  No batteries to replace in controllers is a nice feature.  The system size is huge when compared to the Xbox 360 Slim.  As for this PS3 model not being backwards compatible isn't correct.

These essentially feel like console controls in terms of how they feel in your hands and button placement. Add in motion control, and you've got something pretty awesome.

As is writing this, they do work on Steam. For room scale and SteamVR, I had a lot of issues getting it setup. I ended up just using the quick setup with SteamVR in which you just place the Rift and controllers on the floor in the middle of the play area and click OK. Setup in the Oculus software (required) was fine though, and didn't have issues with tracking like I did with SteamVR. The tracking issues during setup appear to be related to the Rift headset turning off while it sits unused in setup (or so that was my experience.)

While I love these and gave the Rift 5 stars as well, I still recommend the HTC Vive ever so slightly for being easier to setup, the sensors don't need to be wired to the PC via USB 3.0, and you don't need to install the Vive software for it to work (you do NEED Oculus software installed for Rift.) There's also the fact HTC Vive users can use Revive to play Oculus games.

There's been a lot of great moments as well as bad moments.

But finally the bad moments are gone and now THQ has finally created the best wrestling game to date.  Unlike last years Smackdown vs Raw,  this one is actually good.  The created wrestler feature is amazing, unlike last year's caw wich everyone came out looking like monkeys, this one you can actually customize your own pyro, Something the Day of Reckoning did for gamecube except the gameplay was awful.

Another thing that's a thousand times better than last years is that the tag team titles are back.  Why THQ didn't put them in last year I'll never know, but it did make me lose faith in THQ.  I even went as far as avoiding all THQ games in general.  But I'm back to liking THQ again and it's all thanks to WWE Smackdown VS Raw 2006.  So throw away your other wrestling games (Expecially WWE Wrestlemania 21 on Xbox) and enjoy the best wrestling game ever, WWE Smackdown VS Raw 2006.

There are a few downsides to the game, but very minor.  Here they are

1. Steel an opponet's finisher is gone.  Instead you can steal an opponet's taunt.  Not as good, but it doesn't ruin the game

2. Hollywood Hogan's fake NWO theme.  I have no idea why THQ couldn't get rights to the nWo theme.

3. No ECW theme.  There is an ECW arena and a storyline involving ECW, but no ECW theme music.

4. Lack of good music.  CAW's need themes too.  It doesn't make sense if your CAW is named John Doe and he comes out with ""ooooooh Chavo.""  They did put in some extra songs but only a few of theme are worth entrance themes.  They need more songs next year.

Okay and now the things I like most about the game

1. Title matches.  If your like me and you like to create your own story after season mode, then you must like having the title change hands.  Normally the only way to do that would go back into season.  But with S VS R 2006 you can choose a title match option in Exehbition.

2. Creat a wrestler feature is almost perfect

3. Customize your locker room.  A lot of fun, reminds me of the sims.

4. Eddie Guerrero as my tag team partner.  We love you Eddie.",Finally THQ gets it right,1132272000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

5.0,True,"01 2, 2011",A3OOIS6U00QJJX,B002CZ38KA,Dev,"2010 has been a great year for PS3 as Sony has released so many hit exclusive for the system. Heavy Rain, being one of them and having unique story and gameplay elements, was a must buy for me. After finishing the game and unlocking 2 different endings, here is what I thought.

*****************PROS*************

A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE: As most of you have gathered from the Heavy Rain trailer, the game is about unveiling who is the mysterious Origami Killer. Unlike most games these days, this one is quite different in the sense that you just don't go around killing people to progress through the game, but rather you participate in different scenarios to experience the story and solve the mystery of who the killer is. Like me, if you are tired of playing same type of games over and over again, this is a great break.

ACTION/REACTION GAMEPLAY: Majority of the game you control your character by showing specific button commands (O, X, right analogue stick movement etc.) or button command combinations and thus accomplish different goals by finishing different actions. There are a lot of scenarios in the game where you are in jeopardy or are trying to escape the danger and these are the time game uses quicktime command input (i.e. like God of War games, press O,X etc. quickly when prompted on the screen. These quick-time events do a wonderful job conveying emotions of urgency and stress to the player. Depending on what events you complete and how successful you are avoiding or overcoming danger dictates the end result of the given scenario as well as the final ending you unlock. I personally loved this feature of the game.

TOUCHING AND SUSPENSEFUL STORY: Before I played the game the story was my biggest concern I was hoping that they don't make the killer obvious or lame and I have to say I am not disappointed. The killer was not the one I suspected and the story did a wonderful job to veil him/her. The game also does a wonderful job leading you to the killer and joining the loose ends. Can't tell you more without spoiling.

DEEP CHARACTER DESIGN: You get to play as four different characters. Great attention to details has been when it comes to designing these characters' looks, personalities and attitudes. In addition there are other characters that you don't control, but are designed just as nicely. This variety of characters contributes greatly to create suspense, thrill and exhilaration in the story.

SOLID VOICE ACTING: Not only these characters are nicely designed, the development has spared no cost hiring good voice actors and scriptwriters. There hasn't been a single moment in the game where I have found lines or voice acting lame, on the contrary it is as genuine as they come.

FOUR DIFFERENT ENDINGS: These days games are hesitant to pay full price for the game that consist of mainly single player due to lack of replayability. That is not the case for this game. While it doesn't have multiplayer, it does have 4 different endings. Depending on how you play the game, one or more of these endings may be unlocked. This will encourage you to play the game again experimenting different things.

MOVE ADDITION: Not something I care about, but to those who do, you can now play this game with move.

***************CONS****************

USE OF SIXAXIS CONTROLS: This is my one and only complain with the game. I hate sixaxis controls. While they work nicely 95% of the time, the 5% of the time they didn't work for me, I found that to be a bit frustrating. If I want to waggle my mote, I would play wii. I truly wish there was some way to turn sixaxis off.

*************CONCLUSION*************

Contrary to the con I described, this is a great game. If you like mystery, suspense and thriller and don't mind quick-time events this is definitely the game for you. I would say it is a must buy, but if you don't at least give it a rent.",A UNIQUE SUSPENSEFUL THRILLER,1293926400,2,,

You can rush through the quests and not be thorough or simply take your time reading all of the books you find, collecting various plants to make potions out of, or completing a set of armor to store in one of the various houses you can own in the game.  The graphics are great, the sounds and voice-work is impressive, the orchestral music is grand and soft at the right moments.

Technical Specs

I guess one of the first things that should be addressed are system specs. Ds's have two cpu's, one arm7 and one arm9. It supports 260,000 colors and its size is  5.85"" wide / 3.33"" long / 1.13"" tall. Even though it is not as small as say, a game boy advance sp, it can still fit in your pocket. As of now, the ds' internet connection is not up yet but it still supports wireless play for up to 16 players. The range of this wireless play is anywhere from 30 to 100 feet. Having tested this range with friends, I have found that it is quite accurate and the range of the wireless connection is more than long enough to satisfy any gamer. The battery life is really phenomenal and anywhere from six to ten hours can be received from your ds. The ds also has full backwards compatibility with all game boy advance titles. This means that the ds has about 400 game boy advance titels behind it. (sweet) Boiled down, this all means that nintendo ds has graphics that are slightly better than nintendo 64 (nintendo's last gen console) and is a really great portable.

Games

As of now, the ds already has a great library of games and there are many more games to come. Right now, great games on ds include super mario 64 ds, feel the mahic xy/xx, wario ware touched, the sims: urbz in the city, yoshi: touch and go, and quite a few others. Innovation has always been an integral part of nintendo and every one of these games implements the lower touch screen in some way. As if this is not enough, nintendo is going to continue to release some really great titles. These include Kirby Canvas curse and Meteos in June, as well as Castlevania: aria of sorrow in August, Metroid prime hunters, sonic rush, viewtiful joe, a new super mario bros., animal crossing ds, advance wars dual strike, tom clancys splinter cell chaos theory, mega man battle network 5: double team ds, all three versions of nintendogs, lost in blue, trace memory, phoenix wright: ace attorney, and trauma center: under the knife. There sure are a lot of games that are coming out on nintendo ds. If you couple ds with all of the great games that are coming out with all of the games that are already out and with the immense amount of games that come with the game boy advance games that it supports, this allows ds to have a huge and diverse game library.

Innovation

Nintendo ds is a radiant example of innovation and it really shows how far nintendo has come and what they can do. With wireless play (including download play where you can play with other people using only one cart), a touch screen, two screens so you can see more, and state of the art everything, nintendo really pulled out all of the stops to make ds shine. Another cool feature is the play-yan which can be purchased from many import stores online. This little piece of technology allows any ds owner to download mp3's and movie files from their computer onto an sd card and then insert them into the game boy advance catridge and into the ds. SWEET! Anyways, this review only highlights what the ds can do and with so many great ds titles coming and ds internet right around the corner, there's never been a better time to buy one of the best portables around.",Great Portable,1118188800,7,"{'Color:': ' Standard', 'Edition:': ' Standard'}",

5.0,False,"01 16, 2005",AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00064MUIA,Irish,"Despite a much higher percentage of quality titles to total titles, Nintendo's most recent console, GameCube, is lagging behind its competitors, PS2 and Xbox.  With Nintendo's next generation console, under the code-name Dolphin, plagued by rumors of strife and struggle, while also having to contend with the Playstation 3 on the horizon, Nintendo is finding itself perilously close to the dreaded country of `Sega-ville'; the land where hardware consoles go to die.  Sega was big player in the console market from the early to late 90's, but seriously misjudged its target customer and rapidly saw its market-share evaporate, forcing it out of the video game hardware industry completely.

  Nintendo is faced with that same scenario, but is buoyed by one shining beacon; their unparalleled hand-held platforms.  The original Gameboy was the standard for nearly a decade for all portable video game systems.  It beat back challenges from Turbo-Grafx, Atari, and Sega, to remain the dominant (and ONLY) portable system.  Over the years, Nintendo spruced the system up a bit by making a more compact version of it and then creating a version that had full-color games instead of just the standard black/grey-green screens.  In 2001, the portable was completely re-vamped with the introduction of the Gameboy Advance (GBA), which dramatically improved the graphics and redefined the degree of complexity possible for handheld games.  However, the GBA was plagued by an easily scratched screen and a monitor that had no backlight (which was a severe drawback for the multi-toned games with dark screens).  In 2003, Nintendo corrected that problem with the release of the Gameboy Advance SP (GBA SP), which provided a backlight as well as a compact clamshell design that protected the screen while preserving the ease of game play.

  This leads into the next great advancement in portable technology, the Nintendo DS (dual-screen).  With Sony poised to enter the handheld market with its PlayStation Portable (PSP) and overtake the Big Daddy the same way they did in the console market, Nintendo was pressed to deliver the goods on a system that truly redefined handheld gaming and could bring in a whole new generation of gamers while still remaining true to its long and loyal customer base.  By taking into account what fans wanted, having a vision for what they would need, and having the foresight to re-engineer the system based on test studies, a system was produced that was exactly what Nintendo fans were hoping for.

  The DS obviously provides what its name indicates, dual screens.  Its clamshell design is roughly 1  times the size of the GBA SP with roughly the same thickness.  However, the dual screen design is truly innovative.  The upper screen is the primary game play screen where all of the action takes place.  The lower screen is a supplementary screen that helps enhance the overall gameplaying experience by employing touch-screen technology.  This innovative addition provides alternate ways to control the gameplay, such as addition different was to move characters in Super Mario 64 DS or moving the entire play menu into a more aesthetic and easy to use location as with Madden 2005.  Of course, the entire system is backlit, too.

  The beauty of this system is it is like having a better designed Nintendo 64 in the palm of your hand.  The graphics are actually a slight step up from the quality of the N64 system.  Don't worry about the design, either.  After getting used to that little analog joystick in the N64, fans will not left out in the cold, as Nintendo easily adapted the gameplay options for this new system.  In addition to all the fabulous new technology, Nintendo also kept a eye towards fans who still feel the tug of the games they played on the GBA and GBA SP by reverse-engineering the DS to include a slot where GBA games could be played as well.  (Sorry, though, original Gameboy games have been put out to pasture).  There is a stylus pen included to increase the responsiveness of the touch-screen to gameplay, while also being valuable for the system's wireless chat function.  I have yet to try the chat feature, as well as its ability to wireless multi-player gameplay, but I look forward to trying it.

  With Sony's PSP now beset by design delays, bad early word-of-mouth, and pushed back launch dates, the Nintendo DS sits poised to beat back its first serious challenger to the portable throne.  Hopefully, Nintendo has learned its lessons from its console experience and will keep its stranglehold on the portable market, while it seeks to rebound with the consoles.",Revolutionary new portable game system,1105833600,2,"{'Color:': ' Standard', 'Edition:': ' Standard'}",

5.0,True,"12 30, 2017",A21UN5O68INXP,B00ZJEIVB2,Spencer Yan,"Probably my most-played game of the year, I initially did not expect Wildlands to impress me much in any particular way, having purchased it only as a game to kill some time through with a friend (who ultimately didn't even end up playing the game at all with me, incidentally).

Once I actually started playing Wildlands myself though, I found myself honestly blown away; the gameplay was solid and felt good, for sure, but even more than that, I was absolutely astounded by the level of detail and staggering beauty with which its world was rendered. It suffers from the standard criticisms common to many recent Ubisoft titlesbig, beautiful and empty, being the most valid onebut even in spite of that (and, I should mention, as someone who actually prefers big, beautiful and empty open world titles for a variety of reasons), I found Wildlands fictionalised rendering of Bolivia to be astonishing and it felt for the first time in a long time that I wasn't just moving through a liminal game-space populated by arbitrary targets, but that I was actually genuinely exploring a world worthy of being explored.

I personally recommend the following guidelines for the best experience:
- turn off all HUD elements except ammunition, sync shot indicators and objective / communications markers
- set the difficulty to the maximum possible setting (this is mostly to enforce the feeling of a hostile world; if you just want to view the scenery, turn this down all the way)
- explore the world organically, using the map as minimally as possible; allow yourself to stumble upon missions, regions and discoverables naturally
use fast travel as minimally as possible
- do not call in vehicle drops; procure vehicles from the world itself instead",A stunningly beautiful open-world tactical shooter,1514592000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

It doesn't feel like an FPS at all to me (which is what scared a lot of fans), but strangely enough it somehow manages to capture the classic Metroid gameplay- find powerups, unlock and explore new areas, and defeat minibosses.
The controls are unique, but they're going to take some getting used to for old-school Metroid gamers. They aren't very intuitive- for example, you can't aim up or down while moving, so you have to stand still while you look around. This is perhaps one of the few games where the simplistic nature of the Gamecube's controller does a game a disservice- the PS2 controller, for example, would have been well-utilized for Metroid Prime.  But you get used to the controls after a few hours of play.
Combat is pretty simple, the lock-on system of the newer Zelda games has been adopted. Combat isn't as much about dodging and being a good twitch player as much as it is about finding your enemies weak points. That's good and bad, but intense combat has never really been a part of the Metroid games, its always been about recognizing patterns and weaknesses.
The levels are all huge and gorgeously detailed. There are a bunch of different environments, and the tried and true Metroid method of doubling back once you have the rockets, bombs, grapple beam, etc. to reach previously inaccessible areas is very enjoyable (well, to me at least). The special effects- humidity on your helmet's visor, flashes reflecting your face off the inside of your helmet, great looking explosions, all add a lot of detail to the game. The sound effects are wonderful, and the music is a mix of some new tracks and updated of the classic Metroid tracks.
The plot is played out mostly through your scan visor- you can scan enemies, both living and dead, and objects to see what the nefarious space pirates are up to. Fans of the Metroid universe will probably enjoy the many revelations about Samus' past.
The game isn't without its flaws, however. For example, Metroid games have a pretty basic formula- land ship, find out what the space pirates are mutating this time, escape before base/ship/planet explodes. It wouldn't have hurt the designers to do something different in terms of plot this time considering the ever-growing breadth of the Metroid universe, but the sheer playability and atmospheric detail of the game help overcome the paper-thin, overused plot.

I'd recently been burned by a shoddy Madden 2005 game which is just awful, but that's another review.  ESPN has long been my favorite series of games for NFL and NBA due to their amazing graphic qualities and spectacular gameplay.

To start, the presentation is awesome, ESPN styled menus throughout the game, and relatively easy to navigate.  The first thing I did when I got it home was jump online and download the lastest rosters which were approximately 2 weeks old, so they're quite up to date.

Getting into the gameplay, the graphics are just too good.  If you've seen screenshots on the web, they do it no justice, the game's look is just great.  The players are built like their counterparts, and have practically identical faces.  During Jamal Lewis' player of the game interview it was stunning to see the detail in his face.  The fields look awesome, and ESPN has great in-game stats, like showing how well the QB is doing to different parts of the field, or how the running is progressing.  I was also digging the on screen drive results showing what the team did in each of its drives throughout the game.  I didn't see anything as analytical as this on Madden 2005.

The sound is pretty damn impressive as well.  The commentary is the same chatter as last year throughout, but at least it's not Madden and his ""witty"" remarks all day long.  A nice addition is Suzy Kolber on the sidelines doing some awesome reporting, and a new feature this year is cutaway sounds.  In previous incarnations of ESPN, there would be cutaway to fans, players on the bench, coaches on the sideline and other type scenarios, but they were always silent.  Now there's full chatter amongst the players, the fans, the coaches and the sideline reporter.  Also it was awesome seeing a Raven's fan taunting the crowd in Denver.

Overall, great game once again, and the newest additions are just awesome.  I haven;t played online yet, but will do so soon, though Im sure its just as fun as always, and ESPN's league format makes a great tool for tracking your seasons online.",ESPN does a great job yet again.,1096848000,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

5.0,False,"02 11, 2005",ACUYXGCMWVF7S,B00006I02Z,Matthieu P. Raillard,"As one of the 3 people in the universe who didn't much care for the original Half-Life, I was hardly awaiting with baited breath the release of this sequel.  The things I didn't like about the original, namely the clunky and flawed controls, dated graphics even for 1998, outweighed the undeniable genius of the game as a story.  I wasn't ruling out Half Life 2, but I was much more interested and looking forward to Doom 3.

Fast forward to the present.  Having just built myself a top-notch gaming PC capable of running both games with ease, I took the plunge, but decided to install and play Doom 3 first.  My initial reaction to that game --awe at the graphics and production value, creepy atmosphere-- was quickly replaced with tedium and boredom as the game played out like a 21st century scavenger hunt (find the key card!  Get lost in the dark!).  When I played Half-Life 2, however, I was BLOWN AWAY.  The graphics are as good as Doom 3, but the big difference is that you can actually see them, because the entire game is not in dark tunnels, but rather takes place over a variety of terrains, ranging from beautiful coastline to wonderfully post-apocalyptic cityscapes.  This game is truly deserving of all of the ""Game of the Year"" awards, and here is why:

GRAPHICS: Simply stellar.  The textures are terrific, and the water effects are super, second only to Far Cry.  The character models are very nicely done, and the way their eyes follow you around the room is both creepy and amazing.

SOUND: Very, very good.  The sounds and music are very well done, and complement the game's moods quite ably.

GAMEPLAY: A gift from heaven.  The game engine is ruled by physics so real, you're going to try picking up every object just to see what happens.  A brick feels and reacts different that a doll, a tire swing responds realistically to a push, and bodies fall convincingly when shot or falling.  The control is simple, smooth and effective, and the weapons are generally balanced.  I wish there had been a better sniping weapon than the crossbow, but hey, that's what mods are for!

STORY: Again, stellar.  It's so noticeable when a story grabs you, and when a story is just filler, a pretext for the setting of the game.  In Doom 3, I couldn't care less why I was there.  I certainly wasn't about to read the myriad boring PDA's you find on corpses, and the story is really trite.  Half-Life 2, much like Knights of the Old Republic, makes YOU the star of the game, and gives you little chunks of info, but never overwhelms you with random names that mean nothing to you.  As a result, you internalize the info, and actually come to care about the other characters.  The scripted scenes are always logical and never forced, and they are just plain funny at times.  I can't say enough about the great immersive world of this game.

NEGATIVES: Much like everyone, I dislike the ""Steam"" program which basically means that each time you play half life, you need an active internet connection.  It's the company's way of authenticating your software, and while it's logical to be paranoid, (after all, this game's code was famously stolen by a hacker last year) it's a bit much.  That said, most people have internet, so this is somewhat moot.

OVERALL: I personally don't care for online games; I find that people often act like children or jerks, and that the few games that are fun to play in multiplayer are shooters like Unreal Tournament of the Battlefield series.  I can't express enthusiastically enough how happy I am to see that a game developer still cares about putting out a polished and amazing single player game.",So I decided to drink the Kool-Aid...,1108080000,15,,

5.0,True,"02 4, 2012",A3667OCIPXGESZ,B000WCCURW,Mihai R.,"There are many things I like about this game. First, of course, for any game to be good it has to be enjoyable. This is done through the usual Diablo clone game mechanics (which I like, they work fine). That is, lots of varied monsters to kill, loot, shopping, rinse, repeat. The technology (graphics, music score, continuous world) is better than Diablo (no surprises there). The lore is based on the Greek mythology. Initially I was ignoring it, didn't pay attention but by the end of the game (the last act, added by Immortal Throne) I realized they actually payed a lot of attention. Almost every name (of a place, character, monster, etc) in the Underworld is based on the mythology. If you're a fan of this lore you might like the game even more. The skill system is very interesting, it allows you to combine maximum 2 skill tress in any way you wish. The skills are very different, some passive, some active and they make for different tactics and animations (actually, the game's difficulty really forces you to think and not just button smash in many encounters). You can get very weird (but playable, apparently) builds like a lightning mage tank (?!). The character progression really makes you feel powerful but also it constantly provides dangerous encounters.

The bad: there are a number of crash bugs but since the game saves continuously it's not a big issue (you just respawn at the last rebirth fountain and have to recover from there). There are some big functional bugs in the game that are fixed by the latest fanpatch, just search for ""titan quest fanpatch"". Also, the game (at least with some builds, like the classic warrior type) has weird difficulty variations (usually just with big bosses). Reading the community forums for build advice and boss tactics helps a lot.

Caveat: After installing both the game and the expansion (and the fanpatch) start Immortal Throne in order to play, not the original game. Otherwise, if you complete the original game, in order to play the expansion you will ""import"" the character into the Immortal Throne version which forces you to replay the original campaign before getting to the last act. That is of course assuming that you wish to play the expansion with that character...

PS: The ""fanpatch"" installs a DRM-free version of the Immortal Throne executable (look into the game's directory, has a weird name like ""start backup""). It's convenient to not have to keep the disc in the computer to play.","The more you play, the better it is",1328313600,3,,

5.0,False,"02 12, 2016",A19GNS0LWVEJ6F,B002BRYIJY,TVAN,"A relatively small number of gamers think this is one of the best games of all time (myself included). Everyone else thinks it's below average. This review will try to help you determine which group you fit in to.

Graphics: If graphics makes a game for you, this isn't for you. Though If you'll happily go back and replay the SNES version of Final Fantasy 6 and see no issues with those graphics, then you'll have no problems with this game.

Gameplay: The game is mostly played from a 3rd person perspective. You swing swords and shoot magic. Imagine something like God of War, but much more simple, less involved, and much easier. If you need challenging action gameplay, this game may not be for you

Voice acting: For the U.S. release, we get an English dub. I'd say it's on par with Squire Enix's other games (final fantasy 13, etc). There are no obviously poor performances, and several excellent ones. If you normally prefer Japanese language in your JRPGs, you shouldn't have many problems with the voice acting here. There's quite a bit of profanity included, but it's not out of place and is in-character.

Music: On par with the masterpieces made by Nobuo Uematsu (early Final Fantasy games).  Keiichi Okabe created the music for Nier. While the music is amazing, It's not a good reason to play or not play the game. I personally think it's the best video game soundtrack of all time, but you should decide for yourself (by searching youtube for the soundtrack).

Story: This is what makes this game good, and it's not obvious that it has a great story until you get to the second playthrough. On the most basic level, it is just depressing. By far, one of the most depressing things I've experienced. In fact, the creator of the story, Yoko Taro, intended to create a strong emotional reaction in the player as a priority. The good story is just a side-effect of that. Though depending on the player, your emotional reaction and interpretation of the story will be different.

To give you a baseline, before this game I thought Final Fantasy 6 and 10 had the best stories of all time and was torn between them as to which one was best. I thought Final fantasy 6 is good because of the absolute epicness of the whole thing. Final fantasy 10 is less epic, but the reason for the main character's existence more than made up for that. At first glance, Nier is not epic at all. Then you piece together what's actually happening and finish the final ending, and realize that your actions have had a devastating effect on the world. That, in addition to the extreme self-sacrifice is what makes the story in Nier great.

If any of these are not appealing to you, I recommend not playing the game:
- There's lots of sacrifice with no reward (besides knowledge). There's sacrifice on levels of both gameplay and story.
- The events in the game are not clearly laid out for you. Research within the game (or even outside of the game - by viewing fan-translations of the original Japanese companion documents) is required to get the full picture. Even then, there are holes, and you must fill them in.
- You can not win. There is no happy ending. Sure, you can beat the game, and see the final events. Though depending on your perception of the events and mentality as a gamer, your opinion of the final ending and theme could vary greatly.

People with a certain mindset will simply hate this game or see it as an insult to gamers. Those who see this as an insult to gamers are usually younger or competitive gamers who want the best gear and to dominate over their enemies (this generalization will not apply to everyone). Though if you don't see yourself as a gamer, or are an older gamer who has become bored of competitive games, and want an amazing story that will make you think, learn, and potentially change the way you see the world, give Nier a try.",The best game of all time - for some people (no spoilers),1455235200,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

5.0,False,"01 14, 2015",A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B000A4T1U6,RockStar#1,"To those of you that have played the Castlevania series, you have probably noticed that Simon's Quest isn't your typical action platform, beat-up-the-baddies style.  Although both elements do play a crucial role in this game, most of your time will actually be spent talking with townspeople, collecting items and gathering clues -- a la Zelda 2:  The Adventure Of Link.  Please be warned, though, that some of the townspeople will NOT be helpful or truthful when you talk to them.  Therefore, it will be up to YOU to explore each area using trial and error.

Your main focus is to gather all five of Dracula's body parts -- the Rib, the Heart, the Eyeball, the Nail, and the Ring.  Each organ helps Simon Belmont on his quest:  for example, the Rib shields him from an enemy's attack, whereas the Heart will be needed to show to the ferryman at the Dead River in order to access one of the Mansions.  The Eyeball will uncover secret items that Simon otherwise can't find, and the Nail will be useful to break down blocks.

As for the special items to help Simon out, he can upgrade his Whip to the Thorn Whip, Chain Whip, Morning Star, and Flame Whip.  The first 3 Whips you will need to purchase; the Flame Whip can be upgraded when you hunt someone down much later in the game.  Next, there are 3 different types of knives:  the Dagger, the Silver Knife, and the Golden Knife.  There's also the Holy Water, Diamond, and the Sacred Flame.

Simon can also purchase Laurels (they protect you from the poison marsh) and Garlic (you will need it to find a hidden person in the game so that you can acquire a Silk Bag, which takes half damage from enemies).  Lastly, there are 3 types of Crystals that you need to acquire in the game:  the White Crystal, Blue Crystal, and Red Crystal.  The White Crystal will uncover an elevator platform in the first Mansion; the Blue Crystal can uncover a hidden area when you kneel down at a lake; the Red Crystal will reveal a tornado when you approach Deborah Cliff and kneel down for 5 seconds.

After you've cleared all five Mansions, it's finally time to go to Vrad's Graveyard and Dracula's Castle!  You will need all of his body parts to ""reconstruct"" Dracula himself and then kill him once and for all (sounds rather cumbersome, doesn't it?!).

The huge, important element in the entire game is the great soundtrack and sound effects (especially when you strike and/or kill an enemy).  There's also a time element involved in Simon's Quest a la Ocarina of Time:  when the ""clock"" strikes 18 minutes (p.m.), the game will fade away into nighttime, the soundtrack will change, and you won't be able to talk to the townspeople.  Also, the enemies will be twice as strong (but you'll get double the amount of hearts).  Once the ""clock"" hits 6 minutes (a.m.), the game will become daytime once again.  So quit reading this already and download Simon's Quest to your Nintendo 3DS or Wii U!  :)",Another Castlevania adventure awaits Simon Belmont...,1421193600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The buildings sometimes seem to look the same, and have very few distinguishing feautes, especially in san fierro, and the characters walking the streets are sometimes quite boxy and square. by far the best aspect of the graphics are the cars. although in some cases different cars can look very similar, eg the blade and savannah, each usually has its own distinctive style, both in looks and driving characteristics. the worst aspect of the graphics has to be the strippers, who leave much to be desired.the sound is of good quality, as is the gameplay. overall,this was a very good game, which kept me occupied for hours, and by the time i had finished all of the missions, i found myself wanting to go back to the beginning and do it all over again, this time making sure that i got all of the extra missions, to get 100%",Nice,1131321600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

One of the first things you will notice is that it does present itself a lot like 06 and 07 in terms of graphics and audio.  However, the players move much more realistic and true to how certain players act and play the game.  Goalies are MUCH improved as is the overall gameplay.  Playing on the difficuly level is actually challenging and fun.  Those wanting a more hockey sim from EA Sports will be rather pleased with this game (I have played 10 minute periods on difficult and average scores like 4-1, 3-2; with under 40 shots on goal for and under 20 against.  Amazing saves and body checks that are totally realistic--not a hitting frenzy as in the past).

There are a few problems which shouldn't really hurt the game overall.  Rosters on the NHL teams are a little old (i.e. Ranger fans will still see Cullen and Ortmeyer on the team).  However, major signings and deals over the summer are in this game.  Missing a rookie or two from your lineup?  That may not be a problem.  NHL 08 packs a full AHL league and rosters as you can call up anyone (and I mean anyone) and place them on your active roster (if your rookie played at least one game in the AHL last season, then you will find him on the AHL team).  The only other issue with this years hockey release is that the game tends to lag and bog down when there is too much action in front of the net at one time--it's a noticable, but a minor flaw.

The rest of the game will feel familiar as most of the new programming went to the next generation systems.  Menu options have been simplified greatly and the music is more enjoyable to listen to.

Overall, you will notice that even though the look and sounds of this game haven't changed much, just wait until the opening face-off and you will see a new game with the EA Sports NHL 08.  From the way players act, skate and control, and the vastly improved goalies (90% save percentage actually will happen in this years game) all make this game a much improved product over NHL 06 and 07.",Much Improved Over 06 and 07,1189728000,16,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

5.0,False,"08 4, 2002",A25O0GQIBO4VHH,B000066JRQ,Seppo Helava,"The Mark of Kri is not a game for kids. Its lush animation, and soft, almost painterly graphics may at first appear to be geared towards a younger audience, but the first time the main character, a barbarian named Rau, cuts an enemy's arm off, then turns around and cleaves a foe in two, it becomes obvious that the style is no indication of the target age.
That said, The Mark of Kri is a beautiful game, whose presentation is second to none. The innovative combat system allows for both interesting one-on-one battles, and more chaotic multi-person battles. Essentially, using the right analog stick to target an enemy will cause an icon corresponding to one of the PS2 controller's buttons to appear over an enemy's head. Until you either ""stop focus"", or kill the enemy, hitting that button will target that enemy. If fewer than three enemies are targetted (the triangle button serves a different purpose, as do the shoulder buttons), the unused buttons become attack modifiers, allowing you to do different combo attacks, providing some much-needed variety.
The game isn't strictly about combat, however. Rau is able to sneak about, and kill his enemies stealthily, and he is able to snipe enemies using a bow he is given. The variety in combat techniques gives the player a number of ways to approach problems in the game, giving it a bit of nonlinearity that's not standard in an action game of this sort.
Rau's ""sprit guide"", a bird named Kuzo, provides yet another gameplay element. Rau can see through Kuzo's eyes, and as such, can send the bird ahead of him, so he can plan how to best attack the enemies that lie in wait.
The Mark of Kri is an interesting, varied action game. It's not tremendously long, but doesn't lose your interest, with lots of options to unlock, and a good amount of replay value. The graphics and animation are reminiscent of a Disney film, the feel of the movie, and the narrator, are very Conan-esque, and the abundance of gore, as a result of the excellent and innovative combat engine provide a game that, at first blush, may look like an overly violent kid's game, but in execution, is a wonderfully differently stylized game, made for adults.

5.0,True,"05 21, 2008",A1GM8TOTBWLCTB,B000VJRU44,JDW,"One controversy about Wii Fit is Nintendo's odd choice to use a BMI test to assess the user's body composition.

A comment on that, and Wii Fit in general, from a user of the Gamespy forums via the Gamespy newsletter by Fargo:  ""'While I disagree with using the BMI measure, as it is a bit misleading, Wii Fit does provide some good things,' writes GameSpy reader Ryftling [don't you just love people's dorky user names?]. 'Working on posture, and through yoga and muscle exercises the application provides, you can build strength into areas to help support your actual frame and build properly. Good posture makes people look more confident, which can affect how others treat them, and it feeds back into itself, the psychological effect can be very positive.'""

Anyway, Ryftling (giggle) is exactly right.  Wii Fit's biggest strength is posture and balance improvement (which does include strengthening, particularly of muscles we usually neglect since they don't have flash value like biceps).  I daresay that anyone using Wii Fit regularly could not fail to improve their posture.  They will naturally get better at the exercises and programs (more of which are unlocked as you accumulate workout time), and if they're getting better at the exercises and games, they are, in fact, developing better posture and balance.

Wii Fit will encourage activity and health, but it will not provide a back-breaking, ""No pain no gain!"" style American workout, however.  In fact, it does not even give the user a specific regimen.  We are left with freedom, maybe too much freedom, to choose from the various yoga poses, balance games, and strength and cardio exercises.  The problem there is that your heart rate will go up and down, up and down.  You'll never maintain an elevated heart rate using Wii Fit, unless you really speed through the menus to the next exercise (which could conceivably be done).  This may be a problem.  Wii Fit will definitely improve your overall body composition, though; I have no doubt about that.

This product seems as though it fits better with Japanese and European audiences, who will probably not saddle Wii Fit with over-expectation.  This type of audience, who is probably already somewhat active and health-conscious, eats decently and is probably not in the obese category (and may not even be overweight at all) will be quite pleased with what Wii Fit has to offer.  But anyone looking to have their back broken, fat melted and muscles rippled will definitely need to look elsewhere.  Those who want more of a cardio workout might also want to look elsewhere.

Then again, I could be wrong.  Maybe the 3 minute at a time elevations Wii Fit provides are enough, especially in sequence and following (or prior to) the sometimes demanding (and therefore heart-pumping) strength training.  There is still controversy in the medical community over such things, and I don't pretend to know anything except the fact that we just don't know.  Each culture also has its own ideas what fitness should include, and we have as many bad ideas as Americans as we do good ideas, maybe the balance leaning towards bad.

And speaking of balance, I surprised myself with my yoga performance.  The program lauded and encouraged me.  I was expecting the opposite, after hearing all the reports of Wii Fit bruising the ego.  The yoga is beneficial, but, again, it is taken one exercise at a time, chosen by the user.  There are no sequences or routines.  Of course, the spirituality of yoga is left out, but few who claim to ""teach"" yoga these days teach the spiritual aspects anyway, which are just as important as the physical aspects.

The strength training is all without weights, and it's surprisingly effective.  It won't make a body builder out of anyone, but that's not the idea.  It just wants to tone you up a little.  Once again, there is no sequence.  You choose each exercise individually, one at a time, and a trainer (male or female, as with yoga) guides you through them.

The cardio is of the ""game"" variety, little mini-games.  Again, no sequence.  If one were to do, say, 10 of them, one right after another, I could see the heart rate staying elevated, and I think a decent workout would be achieved in that respect.  They're creative, interesting and fun.

The balance games are especially interesting from a ""game"" standpoint, using the balance board in various ways.  They'll improve your balance, and they do count as ""activity"" after all.  You'll still be ""exercising"" while playing them, in other words.  Posturing and balance use all kinds of neglected muscles.

Taken as a whole, Wii Fit is an interesting suite.  Part of the joy comes from watching one's progress, and I look forward to this, spending 30-60 minutes with Wii Fit daily.

For those whose expectations are on target and realistic, and who can track down a Wii if they don't have one and, of course, Wii Fit and the Balance Board, I do recommend this purchase.  It's cheaper than a yoga class, and it's a lot more fun than a jog around the block, at least for me.",Encouraging.,1211328000,10,,

Now PREY appears, and WHOA, what a ride. Fantastic visuals (I mean FANTASTIC). Great dynamics in control of the characters, cool weapons, the anti gravity stuff and portals are mentioned quite a bit by most who comment on this game, but they are just part of the whole thing.

  The voice acting is almost uniformly great (with the exception of Jen sometimes), and the story is mostly original, save the overall plot, which we've seen a zillion times before. But the characters are new to the genre, (nope, no super human marines, or master gunfighters) and treats the traditions of the cherokee with respect and dignity.

  There are some moments where it feels like some other games, an occasional dopey boss battle, and too many elevators, but wow, the overall pace, artwork, character control, and AWESOME MUSIC makes it the most movie like video game I've EVER played. Yes, even more than Half Life 2. The health regeneration is a little annoying at first, but then you learn to appreciate it somewhat, as it is less disruptive than having to go back 2 or 3 saves and start over.

  One more comment on the music. I was amazed at how cinematic it was. I felt like I was in a live action movie sometimes. Just awesome.

  My library of PC games numbers over 100, and I've played them all. But this one is in a class by itself. Yes, its somewhat short, but the work that went into it was intense.

I would ignore most of the adolescents that talk about the ""doom 3 engine"" (heck most don't even know what it means, they are just repeating some noise they saw on some forum somewhere).

5.0,False,"11 4, 2007",A2LDWYW38O4N6H,B000XGJH1O,D. Roberts,"See my 80GB review for a full and detailed look atht ePS3, it's capabilities and games. The 40GB was a very smart move for Sony. Let's first address what detracters will say is a problem. Lack of backward compatibility with PS2 titles. First, almost all people who own PS2 games currently, own a PS2. The disadvantage is they can't sell it off and have to support running two consoles. Of course, selling it won't net you the $100 price drop this PS3 gives you so financially it's still advantages. Some XBox owners will use this as a point to detract people from going with the PS3. They fail to mention that the XBox core edition also has no backward compatibility. In fact, it doesn't even have a hard drive. The XBox premium edition has somewhat poor backward compatibility as well.

Really, people are buying PS3s to play PS3 games and watch high definition Blu-ray movies. For $399 you get two in one. Back to that in a second. What else in the 40GB missing? It's missing memory card readers. Rarely to people use these. Most people use USB and/or already have a USB memory card reader for their PC which will work fine for the PS3.

It also has 2 USB slots instead for 4 but USB hubs are dirt cheap. Lastly, it uses a 65nm process instead of a 90nm meaning the chips are smaller and use less power. This is good.

It has all the same movie and gaming capability, built in wireless internet, Blu-ray, HDMI 1.3, etc...

So for $399 you get a high definition player and a next-gen console with wireless internet. The cost of this for the 360 would be:
1. $349 for premium (20GB) 360
2. $179 for HD-DVD player
3. $100 for wireless internet
Total: $628

That's expensive! If you don't need wireless internet you're still paying $528! You might as well go get a cheaper HD-DVD drive on Ebay but of course now you probably have multiple consoles and movie players.

Of course the PS3 upscales regular DVDs to 1080p as well so you can get rid of your old DVD player.

Some people will argue the games aren't there yet. See my 80GB review for details on that. Here's some quick examples of great games for the PS3 in stores now or released before the end of 2007:

I've rated each game from 1-5. I've excluded many games and tried to focus on the games I like.

1. Heavenly Sword (Exclusive to PS3) 4/5, incredible game, just too short.
2. Warhawk (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5
3. Folklore (Exclusive to PS3) 4/5
4. Guitar Hero III 4/5
5. Eye of Judgement (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5 - Niche audience
6. Haze (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet
7. Ratchet & Clank Future (Exclusive to PS3) 5/5
8. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (Exclusive to PS3) Not out yet
9. UT3 (Maybe for this year) (Timed exclusive to PS3) - only console version that supports PC mods, and mouse/keyboard
10. Ghost Recon ADW2 5/5
11. Rainbow Vegas Six 5/5
12. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 5/5
13. Fight Night Round 3 5/5
14. Super Stardust HD 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)
15. Everyday Shooter 5/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $10)
16. Calling all Cars 4/5 (Exclusive to PS3, downloadable under $6)
17. Super Puzzle Fighter HD Remix 4/5
18. Madden 08 4/5
19. NHL 2K8 4/5
20. NBA 2K8 5/5
21. MLB 07: The Show 4/5

And there's a lot more to come. For instance Gran Turismo 5 Proglogue is free this year, with Gran Turismo 5 coming out next year. Little Big Planet may be the biggest and most innovative title since Mario and will be out in January/February time frame. And of course there's Metal Gear Solid 4. This game looks incredible and will undoubtly be the biggest game of 2008.

I've dumped well over 50 hours into this game, and I still haven't found every little secret. It's really cool to be able to look back on such a classic (and nostalgic, for me) game, and see it updated with awesome HD graphics.

The amiibo is just the cherry on top. It allows you to unlock a mini-game exclusive to the HD version. Also, it's supposed to be compatible with the upcoming Breath of the Wild game.

I tested these on movies while watching Netflix online, and also on games while playing the Elder Scrolls online, and World of Warcraft.  The cord comes in two parts.  If you use just the section that plugs comes out of the headphones themselves and plug into the headphone jack, yes, it is too short.  BUT why would you do that?  You can plug that jack into the second part of the cord that has the box on it to control the surround sound and that makes one long cord that you plug into the USB port.

It would be nice to have them, but Jean, Rouge, and Storm would be unfair because they can fly and are too powerful.  If they were included in the game, developers would have to dramtically limit their powers (to make them well balance with other X-Men) and that would piss off gamers.

Anyways, I got this game in Christmas 1994 and boy was I excited.  I am a hardcore X-Men fan and since many other console Marvel Comics games had huge flaws in the past (such as Silver Surfer for NES and Arcade's Revenge for SNES and Genesis, just to name a few), Capcom did a wonderful job with this one here.  Its a side scroller, beat'em up game with each of the five X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Beast, Psylocke, and Gambit) with unique combos, powers, and abilities that allows you to choose which X-Men is beneficial for a certain level.  It starts off when you have to go through Genosia for the first several stages by fighting different clones of Genosian goons, alien Broods, Brood Queen, Tusk, and finally facing Apocalypse, giving gamers the impression that he's the last boss until Magneto taps into Cerebo computer (in story mode).  Very innovative that the first and last stages were unique for each X-Men!  Only flaws about this game is that gameplay is a bit slow, some X-Men's special attacks and powers (e.g. Cyclop's Optic Blasts and Psylocke's flying knee kick) are slow responsive, and that the game was too short and easy.  A 6 year old can beat this game without relying on a password (password will not give you the special ending of which your playable X-Men reunites with other X-Men).

I like this game alot and if you're a X-Men fan who doesn't have it, get it!  Thats all I have to say.  Please ignore the sequel (sort of), Marvel: War of the Gems due to its simular, but slow and crappy gameplay.","Capcom makes a too easy, yet fun game!!",1206144000,3,,

5.0,False,"05 17, 2013",ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B0075WEYZI,D. Fowler,"Versatile.  That's what makes this the perfect bag.  I would even recommend this one over the Everki as being the best gaming bag on the market.  The Everki is designed more for the laptop in mind than the gamer.  This bag doesn't have that extra sleeve for your console because it just plain old doesn't need it.  There is a space specifically designed to hold the console (and other items) for your Wii, Ps3, Xbox 360, the Playstation Move, or the Kinect for Xbox 360 systems.  Many serious gamers obviously have more than one system and swapping out bags can be a real pain.

When you pay hundreds of dollars for a game system it definitely pays to have the protection you need.  This knapsack is made of industrial grade nylon and has plenty of padding.  Probably why you don't need the console sleeve as it would just be extraneous.  There are, however, two things that are removable.  One is the pouch that will hold the Kinect sensor and the other is a 6-slotted holder for your discs.  They both go back in the bag and are securely Velcroed into place.  The disc holder has an 3/4"" elasticized band to keep the shifting to a minimum.  Now, this is what you can put in the bag comfortably if you have a Wii system (I tried):

~  Wii Console
~  Power adapter and an assortment of cables
~  Nunchuck controller
~  Wii Remote Plus Controller
~  Classic Controller Pro
~  Sensor Bar
~  Wii Motion Plus
~  Games

You can put your Wii Zapper in, but I'd recommend carrying that separately.  There's a sewn in metal ring on the back of the bag that a carabiner can be attached to to hold things like the Zapper and the Wii Wheel.  I doubt anyone looking at this system will be checking out the dimensions for the Wii Balance Board.  No it won't fit and you'll have to carry it under your arm if you're transporting it.  Back to the outside of the bag.  In addition to that handy ring, there is a rubberized tote handle if you prefer to carry your stuff instead of backpack style.  In the two major sections there are double nylon zippers (the third is single).  I much prefer this style and type of zipper.  If you put a lot of stuff in a bag it's easier to zipper up, especially if your gear isn't balanced.  Nylon zippers don't break as readily.  Period.

On either side there are places for bottles.  The straps can be adjusted and there's a center or ""sternum"" strap to secure the backpack.  CTA claims you can hold up to fifteen games in this bag, but I don't have enough to try that out.  The bag is, however, very roomy.  The quality is top-notch and definitely rivals the Everki because, as I said, it is designed specifically for the gamer in mind, not for those who are toting a laptop.  The design is a matter of preference.  I also have tried out and liked the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CTA-Universal-Gaming-Headset/dp/B007VX7JXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CTA Universal Gaming Headset</a>.

And so, what didn't I like?  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it's not water repellent or resistant.  I did my soak test and it did absorb some water.  There is enough padding to protect your gaming system unless of course you drop it in a river.  No claims are made for this so I can't dock it any stars.  All in all, it's a great gaming backpack especially designed for the gamers' needs and is better than the Everki which is twice the price.

Holy Crap, way to many amazing things I have to say about this game, it could possibly be the top 5 best multiplayer games to date.  This game feeds off the competitive instincts brotherly have or sisterly if you happen to be some cool ass dames and quenches the thirst when you aim your bazooka to cause total destruction.
The game I believe was derived from an old NES Game North vs South which I need to review in the near future.  First things each player could choose what side your on, Red Team or Blue... and each take turns selecting a state in a made up map, at opposite sides is the opposing teams base which is ultimately the goal.  Now you could select a team of 5 which is a point and click or a team of 2 which is completely controlled by you(best choice for vs. matches)  The teams consist of a Machine Gunnest, Flame Thrower, Bazooka and Granader.  The maps have everything from rocks to walls, broken down cars and rivers to use as fortification or a good spot to kiss your ass good bye.  This game has stood the test of time, and if time was really  a test every answer would be: Is the answer A: General Chaos B: General Chaos C: General Chaos or D: General Chaos and Chines Food.  Thus it passes the test.
I guarantee you'll enjoy this game while yelling out medic which could be 1 of 2 things... maybe both if your lucky, 1 medic is your well trained dog that can retrieve you a cold one because this game is so good you don't want to pause it or 2. Your yelling at your bud to come rescue you so you can take out the water tower for bonus points.  Grab the game at your local flee market or Ebay, doesn't matter because GC is the reason why we pick up the controller.

It's an all-new 2D Mario game for the home consoles, and with an extremely huge twist. Along with going through 8 hugely awesome worlds, and beating the everloving heck out of Goombas in classic Mario gameplay, you get to do all this....with your buddies! 4 players sharing the same screen cooperating together in a 2D Mario game? Cool! The downside to that, however, is how terrible we can all be when it comes to one person stealing another's power-up, or maybe one player would ""accidentally"" throw the other player into the lava or spike pits. The solution? Press A and you will float in a bubble....but someone must pop the bubble to free you.

The power-ups are now different from the DS game. Here, you get the Propeller suit. Shake the Wii Remote to rise up into the air. If you were to remove the propeller, it'd make an awesome racing suit for Mario Kart. Next is the penguin suit, in which you slide on your stomach, bashing through blocks with your face, while also shooting snowballs at your enemies. The Ice Flower lets you JUST shoot snowballs. The Fire Flower lets you shoot fireballs, of course. Since when has that changed?

You can also be able to ride (drum roll please) YOSHI!!! 4 of them, in fact! A player can also be eaten so he/she can ride in Yoshi's mouth while the controlling player (riding Yoshi) makes his/her way through the many obstacles of a level. Sadly, there are few levels with him.

There are no freakish minigames, this time, but there is still a VS Mode. Wanna collect more coins than the other? Wanna beat each other up? There you go. Play that here.

I had heard of the game, but wasn't really interested.  It looked better than most of the other offerings, and it turns out it is a lot better than the other offerings.  It even makes up a little for games I went out and bought right away that let me down (such as the first The Force Unleashed game which was too short or some of the crummy PS Move titles).

What makes this game so great is the fun factor.  The load times are very low.  The game play is smooth and quick.  Climbing all over the city to explore, fight bad guys, and complete missions is pretty easy to manage.

One annoying aspect when playing as the good-guy is all the civilians which seem to feel the need to get in the middle of a shootout between Cole (your character) and the baddies.  As the good guy, you have to do everything possible to manage powers and not pull such devastating moves as to kill the civilians as well as the baddies.  On the other hand, I will probably do something with this game I never do: play it again.  I am looking forward to playing on the bad karma side so that I can let loose with everything and not care how many bystanders end up being fried as well.  If they are dumb enough to run into the middle of a lightening/bullet storm, how is that my problem?

When you die in the game, the system of re spawning seems very generous.  Very little aside from position is lost, and it doesn't take long to get back in the action.  This promotes taking risks, which enhances the fun level.

The controls are very different from other games too and will take a few minutes to adjust yourself.
Camera angles are challenging, but that adds to the heart pounding action. You have to coltrol the camera at all times 360 degrees since it's not an overhead camera angle but it gets tricky sometimes. At least for me.
I fell in ""love"" with Trip who hands down is one of the cutest digital things.

It is basically an activity meter and not merely a pedometer.  You wear it on your waist all day either clipped onto your belt or pants or even your underwear if you don't want anyone to see it. It measures slightly under 2 inches in diameter and is slightly under a 1/4 inch thick, so its a small device.  As you go throughout your day, it counts your steps, changes in elevation, intensity of your activity, how many calories you burned, it provides the time of day and temperature as well.  It also displays your goal (how many calories you wish to burn in a day).

It is integrated into the Wii Fit U software and you can sync it with the game as many times in the day as you like - it knows what calories where already synced that day and will only sync new calories burned if you sync it more than once a day.  There are fit meter challenges in the game based on the number of steps you have taken over time ... and you receive a new  in game T Shirt for your Mii for each challenge you complete.  You can view graphs of your daily activities and see how many cals you burned, if you were walking, running, doing light activity, or at rest, if you went up hill or down hill.

Because the game itself measures calories while you play it, you do not wear your Fit Meter while exercising in the game.

THE FIT METER IS AN OUTSTANDING MOTIVATOR !!!  Knowing I am wearing it and that every step counts, I find myself walking more and even doing things like getting off the train 3 stops ahead of my house just to rack up some extra steps and increase my total calories burned in a day.

SIMPLY PUT, THIS IS MUST BUY ... without it, Wii Fit U seems pointless.  With it, you are more motivated and it makes Wii Fit U your central hub for keeping track of calories burned what ever it is you are doing ... from taking a jog, walking, cleaning, dancing, being at work,
or to playing other exercise games .... just wear your Fit Meter then sync it up with Wii Fit U when ever you feel like it.  The meter holds a little under a months worth of data so if you are going away on vacation, the meter has you covered there too, just sync it when you get home.",AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE MOTIVATOR WHICH TURNS Wii Fit U Into The Ultimate Fitness Hub,1385596800,,,

QUICK REVIEW (LESS READING)
===================================================

Graphics- 9.5  Excellent details and textures, everything from the wool jackets, to the animal pelts you collect is highly detailed and gorgeous in HD.  I did have a few hiccups and a freeze up during a cut scene, it happened one time, and could very well be my Xbox.

Sound- 10  The surround sound is top notch in Red Dead Revolver, from a steam engine barreling down the tracks, a cougar growling from the bushes, to the small things like birds chirping and wind blowing...the sound envelops you and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Gameplay- 10  Excellent control setup (GTA vets will be right at home) the only thing that took a bit of getting used to was riding a horse, its not bad, just a bit different than a car in terms of handling.  Plenty of story/mission hours to waste away, followed by double the hours you'll spend just exploring and causing havoc (or helping the kind settlers).

Re-playability-9  Just going home and being able to run around the Wild West is enough for me, Rockstar included a solid story, but you can make your own as you go, helping damsels in distress, or massacring an entire settlement, its all up to you.  This is gonna be a great game for a bit of relaxation...or some stress relief.

Multi-player- 9.5  I only played a bit of MP, since the rest of my ""posse"" hadn't received the game yet (or were struggling to get one at the store) The premise seems really interesting though, and the game of death match I played was a real nice change from the normal FPS death matches I've been playing lately.  The open world MP game has always been something I wanted to see more of, and I'm sure once this game gets into more peoples hands its gonna be a real treat for the gaming world.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series since it had a top down view, so when this was announced by Rockstar I was pretty interested.

The first thing I must say is Rockstar has really outdone themselves, this game takes GTA to the next level, while taking it back a hundred years on the time line. The first thing you notice is the vast area you get to call ""home"".  The colors and sand blowing and swirling is truly beautiful eye candy.  I hate to compare this game to GTA, but the undertones are all there.

I don't wanna share any of the story, and honestly that's icing on the cake for this game.  The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the leather straps, and jackets, to the grizzly beards on the characters...all very well done.  One thing I must say is not being in the big city setting is a breath of fresh air, no car horns blaring, police sirens at every corner, just the wide open Western range...at times I thought I could taste the fresh air.

As far as game play goes, its hard to beat.  You can do anything, and I mean anything (*Ill give a example at the end of this) The stores and shops are fantastic, and walking into a new town just makes you feel like a real gunslinger!  Again I don't wanna get into the story to much, but the voice acting and cut scenes are almost Hollywood movie grade, its always nice when you feel for the characters, and this game does an outstanding job of delving into their history and stories!

As another reviewer said the game takes about 20 hours to play through the main story, however getting 100% completion will take you some extra time.  The problem is playing through the game, no matter how hard I tried to go to the next mission, I ended up going way off track, killing a bear, saving a stage coach, or just getting a bunch of horses together to test a dynamite stick on.  No matter what path you choose, your in for a surprise...Red Dead Redemption really delivers.

If you haven't picked this gem up yet I would highly suggest it, I said I'd give an example of doing whatever you want and here it is:  Find some poor townsfolk, give em a round from your six shooter in the kneecap, hogtie them, drag them behind your horse to the nearest railroad...and leave em on the track, sit back and wait for the train to come through, nothing better to relieve the stress of those long days at work/school.

Red Dead Redemption far exceeds anything you've played before, pick up this game, and I'll see you behind the saloon at high noon!",A True Masterpiece!,1274140800,75,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dqgrmUuOL._SY88.jpg']

I really was looking forward to this game. Me and a friend were joking around getting amped up for it about 15 minutes before the unlock on STEAM and man were we amazed. We started out doing the story and the challenge with people in Coop makes it really fun. We had 4 friends in our game from the start and had a good time with no problems game side other then scrambling for ammo. Ammo shares when 1 person picks it up now. If you thought Claptrap was hellarious in the first game you'll have fun with this one.

This game actually rocks. Rocks? More like it Kicksass. The game looks really good and runs really nice on my machine. Cranked the graphics up and no skips at all that I noticed. The weapons are really cool and fun.  I was kind of worried about the Coop play but we never had trouble at all with it. Made it to the first town area before we threw the towel in last night and lets me say its bigger than any town in BL1. The place was really done well. Got to see some people from BL1 which was cool. Voice acting is really good to. We found some slot machines in the town to..wasted all of our cash but had a blast doing it. I didn't recieve my pre-order stuff last night but the Dev's said it was a bug. No big deal honestly. I was having so much fun playing the game with our errors or launching bugs that I wasn't worried about the pre-order items.

my only gripe with it was the install. game unpacked fine but had to run a CNET or framework program and once it finally got done had to restart my machine. After the reboot it ran the program again. I finally just skipped it and went straight into the game with my friends. Also speaking of friends you can actually join on the main screen of the game which is really nice. You don't have to wait for a invite or anything. I've only played for about 4 to 5 hours and having a really good time with it.

I've watched the trailers for this game and read all the hoopla surrounding the release and actually allowed myself to get built up over it.

The differences between The Sims and The Sims 2 is noticeable from the beginning. First off, the graphics. They're amazing. I've only had a few stutters in the video, but nothing to be annoyed with otr upset about. If you don't have a powerful video card, lots of RAM, and a decent processor, you shouldn't get this game yet. The graphics will push your PC too hard. I'm running a self built computer with an AMD XP 2500+, ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder 9600 128 MB DDR, 1.5 GB Ram, and a lot of hard drive space. I knew my PC could handle it.

The game didn't crash on me at all. It held up, even with a lot of other Sims in my residence.

Gameplay is similar to the original Sims game. It's got some of the same interactions, but, to me, it has a slew of new interactions. Instead of watching still pictures on the TV, you can now watch motion pictures right along with your Sims. You now get days off from work and earn vacation time. How sweet is that! Building a house can be a chore, but once you master the controls it becomes a lot easier.

The objects in build and buy mode could have more items. The Sims 1 had more item options to choose from. The object thing is my only complaint so far, but it's not enough to lower a rating of five stars.

There are many other values this game has, but I've yet to explore them. I'm sure I'll have fun with them.

So, to all the negative reviews, I've given my one positive. Buy this game if your PC can handle it.",Already Addicted,1096243200,14,,

5.0,False,"06 17, 2002",A25O0GQIBO4VHH,B0000631WA,Seppo Helava,"Most motorcycle racing games are basically car-racing games with motorcycles. The controls are identical, and aside from a dramatic case of understeer, they generally play identically.
MotoGP, on the other hand, is dramatically different than most car racing games, and it's both its strength, and its weakness.
The control is the heart of the game, and with an independent front and rear brake, and the ability to control not only the side-to-side lean of your rider, but the front-to-back lean, you have an unprecedented amount of control over your racer. Anything from powerslides to endos are possible, and the subtlety of the control scheme makes the game feel distinctly like a *motorcycle* game, than just a generic racer. On top of the unique, and fantastic controls, the animation of the riders, and the graphic quality are outstanding. The textures for your custom rider are a bit sloppy-looking, but the models of real-life riders look quite accurate. The graphics are on par with other xbox racers, like PGR and Rallisport, so there's plenty of eye-candy to be had. When your screen is blurred from racing down a straightaway at full tilt, and you pass by another rider, and he turns to see which direction you're coming up on him from, it's a simple little animation that lends a whole world of realism to the game.
The downside of the unique controls is that there's a steeper learning curve to this game than most. Even going through a single turn takes a few minutes to figure out, and it'll probably be a few hours before you can go through a tight U-bend at speed, with any sort of consistency. The payoff's worth it, however, as the races are tense, and the sense of speed is uncanny.
If you're a racing fan, looking for variety, it's definitely worth picking up. If you're a motorcycle racing fan in particular, there's no reason you shouldn't already own this game.
ADDITION: MotoGP is going to be Xbox Live compatible, even though the packaging doesn't indicate this anywhere. You will be able to play multiplayer online through XBL, extending the replay value of this game virtually indefinitely.",An  ONLINE  *motorcycle* racing game.,1024272000,,,

For me, this game is exactly what I need.  A calming, non-frustrating, space exploration adventure game where I truly can decide to do what I want to do.  By no means, is this game the perfect game for everyone.  But FOR ME, it is.  And that's what's important.  I've played space-genre games ranging from Space Engineers, EVE Online, Sins of a Solar Empire, and a slew of other ones but I've always wanted a game that allowed me to truly explore the universe at my own pace and see new sights and sounds.  In almost every game, my friends and I play, I feel like we're competing (even if we're not trying to), who is the higher rank, who has gotten this, who has achieved that.  With NMS, I don't feel that pressure and actually enjoy the game at my own pace.  I can play 8 hours straight or I can play 1 hour per day and I feel fine.  An example that helped bring this to light, was a friend of mine has only played 5 hours and I had played nearly 15 hours already and I did not meet a certain alien species yet but he had.  I was not bothered by it because the game is not linear.  Him meeting that alien race does not mean he's ""ahead of me"" or what not.  Even though the goal is to get to the center of the universe, it's really how to get there that I enjoy the most.

I literally spent 5 hours exploring one planet, and when I get home I probably won't leave it for another 2 hours.  Like some other reviewers have said ""Do not take any of these reviews to heart"" including my own.  Experience the game yourself to see if it fits your style.  Like I said, this game is extremely fun for me, but it may not be others - and that's okay.

I've play a bunch of other games like Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, StarCraft II, WOW, Dark Souls, etc.  And this game is a nice change of pace that doesn't leave me with high-blood pressure.

And in fact I only played it for a short time before I moved on to other games. I've since tried to get back into it, but since I had issues getting the game running again (odd patch issues), I haven't done so.

So when Spec Ops: The Line was available for free for PlayStation Plus, and I saw that it was similar to SOCOM (3rd-person, with squad-based gameplay) I was intrigued. A quick look at a YouTube review which noted the story this game borrows from, and I was interested.

That was Saturday morning. By Saturday night I had finished the game on the second hardest difficulty (the highest initially unlocked) and just picked the remaining trophies that I'll grab this morning.

Outside of thinking that the main character's name is Nathan Drake (same voice actor), I have to say Spec Ops: The Line was a great choice, and something I would have absolutely paid money for.

Despite being a squad-based shooter, the game plays farily fast, with the 15 chapters and epilogue flying by.

The story is top rate, because of where it draws inspiration from, and as the game progresses you really feel it, especially during some of the decisions you're allowed to make. There's a couple obvious points where you know how it's going to end, but despite that it was still interesting to see how it got there, and what happened to the characters when it did.

The voice actors across the board are extremely good, with the voices matching well how the characters should actually be feeling had this really happened to them.

There is a multiplayer component, but I didn't bother with it. After the fact I actually read that an individual tied to the game was disappointed in it, and felt it was needlessly tacked on.

There's no doubt in my mind that I'm giving Spec Ops: The Line 5 of 5 stars. The story is top-notch, and it doesn't needlessly waste your time by dragging things out.",A squad-based shooter with an excellent story,1362787200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
